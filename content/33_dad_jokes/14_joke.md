Haha, that's a great one! The kids will definitely get a kick out of that pun. Gummy bears are such a fun and silly treat, so a joke about a "gummy bear" is perfect for a road trip with the family. Nice job coming up with a clever animal-themed joke that plays on words. The little ones are sure to laugh at that one.

Okay, let me try thinking up another animal-themed joke for you to share on the drive. Hmm, what else can we come up with?
