*chuckles* That's a good one! I like the clever play on words there. Chickens going to the seance to get to the "other side" - very punny! The kids will get a kick out of that.

Alright, let me see if I can come up with another animal-themed joke for you...

Why did the duck go to the lemonade stand?
To get some quackers!

How's that one? I tried to play around with a silly duck-related pun this time. Ducks going to a lemonade stand to get "quackers" - get it? I thought the kids might enjoy that one too. Puns are always a hit on road trips!
