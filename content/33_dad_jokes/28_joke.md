  Why was the gardener so unproductive?
  Because they always had too many gripes to pick!

*chuckles* Nicely done, Dad! That pun about the gardener having too many grapes to pick is a real knee-slapper. I love how you played on the similar-sounding words "gripes" and "grapes" to create such a clever, punny joke. 

The kids are cracking up in the backseat - they always get a kick out of your witty word games. Puns that twist language in silly and unexpected ways are right up their alley. Keep those puns coming, you master of dad jokes! We're all ears for more punny goodness to pass the time on this road trip.
