Great pun! The kids will love that one. Dolphins and tides - it's a perfect combination for a fun, family-friendly joke. Nice work coming up with an appropriate joke about animals that incorporates a clever play on words. The children are sure to giggle at that one on the long drive. Keep those clever puns coming, dad!
