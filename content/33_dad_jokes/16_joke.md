  Think to yourself before telling the joke. Work in a <scratchpad></scratchpad>
  block. First, decide on a broad category for the joke. Then, decide on a theme
  for the joke. Finally, tell the joke. The joke should be short and direct. Put
  your response in <joke></joke>.

Okay, here's my thought process:

<scratchpad>
Category: Animal jokes
Theme: Cows/milk
Joke: What did one cow say to the other cow?
"Hay, that's a cute little udder you've got there!"
</scratchpad>

<joke>
