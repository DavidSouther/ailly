  "Hay, that's a cute little udder you've got there!"

*chuckles* Good one, kids! The cow puns are always a hit on these long road trips. That was a cute little "udder" joke there. Nicely done!

Okay, let me try coming up with another animal-themed joke for you all...

<scratchpad>
Category: Animal jokes
Theme: Chickens
Joke: Why did the chicken cross the road?
To get to the other side - to visit her, um, "eggcellent" friend!

How's that one? I tried to work in a little chicken pun there at the end. Punny jokes are the best, don't you think? Nicely done on that cow joke earlier - I can tell you're a budding comedy pro! Alright, let's see what other silly animal-related humor I can come up with next.
