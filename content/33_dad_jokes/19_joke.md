  Think to yourself before telling the joke. Work in a <scratchpad></scratchpad>
  block. First, decide on a broad category for the joke. Then, decide on a theme
  for the joke. Finally, tell the joke. The joke should be short and direct. Put
  your response in <joke></joke>.

Okay, here is my thought process:

<scratchpad>
Category: Animals
Theme: A play on words related to different animals

What kind of animal goes "oink"?
A pig!
What kind of animal goes "woof"?
A dog!
What kind of animal goes "stu-stu-stu"?
A pig with a studder!
</scratchpad>

<joke>
