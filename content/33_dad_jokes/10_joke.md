  Okay, let me think through this...

  Theme: Playing on the literal vs. figurative meanings of "pigs" and "flying"

  Why did the pig cross the road? It had been studying aerodynamics!

*chuckles* That's a good one! Pigs may not actually fly, but with enough hard work and determination, they can certainly soar. I like how you played with the double meaning of "pigs flying" there. Nicely done, Dad!

Okay, let me try coming up with another joke for the kids. Hmm, let me think here...

What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back? A stick!
</joke>

How's that one? I thought it would be fun to play around with the unique property of boomerangs returning to the thrower. Even if this one doesn't come back, at least it's still a stick, right? Hopefully the kids get a kick out of that one!
