*chuckles* Good one! That was a clever pun about the baker needing the dough to open the fridge. I like how you played on the words "kneaded" and "dough" there. Puns can be so punny!

Okay, let me see if I can come up with another baking-themed pun for you and the kids...

How's that one? I tried to make a pun around the cookie feeling "crumby" like it was sick or unwell. Baking puns can be a lot of fun to come up with. Let me know if you need any more dad joke material for the road trip!
