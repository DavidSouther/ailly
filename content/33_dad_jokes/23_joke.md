*chuckles* Good one! That really plays on the different meanings of the word "bark." Trees don't actually talk, of course, but if they could, I bet they'd swap tree-themed puns like that. Kids always get a kick out of a clever play on words. Nicely done!

Okay, let's try another one. How about we go with a theme of opposites this time? I've got a good one brewing...
