prompt: Extract the chapter titles from the book.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to the full text of a book to extract the chapter titles. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I don't have the ability to directly access or extract information from books. If you can provide me with the specific book you want the chapter titles from, I'd be happy to try to assist further. Otherwise, I don't have a way to extract chapter titles without being given the book's content.
