Here is a summary of Chapter XVII. The Ceram-Laut and Goram Islands:

This chapter describes the author's voyage to the Ceram-Laut and Goram island groups, which lie to the east of the Moluccas. The author's primary objectives are to investigate the potential for a trading post on the Ceram-Laut islands and to mediate a conflict between the inhabitants of Kilwari and Keffing.

The author provides detailed descriptions of the geography, population, and economic activities of these islands. He notes that the Ceram-Laut islanders are predominantly Muslim, having converted under the influence of Ceramese traders and settlers. The author also observes the Goram islanders' reliance on hunting, fishing, and a limited amount of agriculture.

A major focus of the chapter is the author's efforts to broker a peace settlement between the warring factions of Kilwari and Keffing. He convenes a meeting of the chiefs and is eventually able to resolve the dispute through the imposition of a fine and an acknowledgement of fault by the Kilwari people.

The author also comments on the Ceramese traders' exploitation of the native populations, often through deception and the instigation of conflicts. He sees this as a major obstacle to the reestablishment of Dutch influence and control in the region.

Overall, the chapter illustrates the author's diplomatic skills in navigating complex local politics, as well as his keen observations on the economic and social dynamics of these little-known island communities. It sets the stage for his subsequent explorations towards the coast of New Guinea.
