Here is a summary of Chapter II. Timor:

The chapter describes the author's voyage to the island of Timor, with the primary objective of the expedition being to examine the condition of the former Dutch settlements and establish friendly relations with the native inhabitants.

Upon arriving at the Portuguese settlement of Dilli on the north coast of Timor, the author finds the town and its inhabitants to be in a state of poverty and neglect. The governor and other officials appear distrustful of the author's presence and intentions. 

The author notes the poor agricultural practices, the active slave trade, and the general discontent among the native subjects of the Portuguese. He is unable to gain much information about the former Dutch holdings on the island.

Departing Dilli, the author sails to the island of Wetta, where he finds the inhabitants glad to see the return of the Dutch and eager for the re-establishment of a Dutch presence and protection. The author confirms the appointment of local chiefs and distributes gifts from the government.

Overall, the chapter paints a picture of Portuguese colonial mismanagement and the longing of the native Timorese population for the return of Dutch rule and influence in the region.
