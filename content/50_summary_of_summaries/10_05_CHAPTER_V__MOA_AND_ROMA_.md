Here is a summary of Chapter V. Moa and Roma:

The chapter describes the author's visits to the islands of Moa and Roma. On Moa, the author is welcomed by the native chiefs and finds the inhabitants to be industrious, prosperous, and deeply attached to Dutch rule, despite the lack of a Dutch presence in recent years.

The author oversees the installation of a new Upper Orang Kaya, distributes gifts from the government, and is struck by the people's strong Christian faith and respect for the remnants of the old Dutch fort on the island. The author notes the islanders' request for a Dutch garrison to be stationed among them.

Proceeding to the island of Roma, the author finds the inhabitants to be similarly advanced in their civilization, with well-ordered villages, thriving agriculture, and active commerce. The author again installs new chiefs, distributes gifts, and is impressed by the natives' loyalty to the Dutch and their desire for a renewed Dutch presence.

Overall, the chapter portrays the Moa and Roma islanders as model examples of the benefits of previous Dutch colonial rule, with the people maintaining their Christian beliefs, industry, and affection for the Dutch government despite the withdrawal of direct Dutch authority in recent decades. The author's interactions highlight their pleas for the restoration of a Dutch colonial administration.
