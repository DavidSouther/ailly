Here is a summary of Chapter IV: Lette:

This chapter focuses on the author's visit to the island of Lette, part of the Serwatty or Southwest Islands group. He arrives at the village of Tombra after departing Kissa.

The chapter describes the devastation Lette's villages had recently experienced - being burned down, crops destroyed, and livelihoods ruined by violent hurricanes and droughts. This had forced many inhabitants into poverty and starvation.

Despite their struggles, the author recounts the friendly welcome he received from Lette's Christian inhabitants. He presides over ceremonial meetings to reappoint village chiefs and distribute gifts from the Dutch government.

However, the chapter depicts the difficulties the author faced in mediating the intense feuds, grudges, and propensity for warfare between Lette's villages over even minor insults. He spends days negotiating reconciliations.

The author also provides ethnographic details about the relatively primitive, underdeveloped state of Lette's native population compared to other islands. He ascribes this to their isolation and lack of governance.

By the end, the author feels he has helped lay the groundwork for the Dutch to reassert their authority over Lette and improve the lives of the islanders after their recent calamities.

Overall, this chapter portrays Lette as a backward, conflict-riven island in urgent need of the renewed security and stability that restored Dutch rule could provide.
