Here is a summary of Chapter VII. Lakor:

The chapter describes the author's visit to the island of Lakor, where he finds the inhabitants to be extremely wary and suspicious of his arrival. The island had previously been under the rule of Moa, but the various villages are now independent and frequently at odds with each other.

The author struggles to gain the trust of the Lakor natives, who flee at his approach. He eventually gathers the village chiefs and oversees the formal installation of an Upper Orang Kaya, distributing gifts from the Dutch government.

The author notes the islanders' simple way of life, with little in the way of agriculture or industry. They rely primarily on raising livestock and gathering wild foods. The author observes their customs, including their method of settling disputes through the exchange of small fines.

Despite the initial distrust, the author is eventually able to establish a degree of rapport with the Lakor people. He departs the island with a sense that reestablishing Dutch authority and influence will be a challenge, but one worth undertaking to bring greater stability and prosperity to the island.

The chapter highlights the difficulties of engaging with isolated, suspicious native populations and the need for a sustained Dutch presence to maintain order and development in these remote territories.
