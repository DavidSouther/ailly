Here is a summary of Chapter XVIII. Goram and the Arru Islands:

This chapter continues the author's exploration of the Goram and Arru island groups. The author provides further details on the economic and social conditions of these territories, highlighting both the commercial potential and the challenges facing the Dutch in reasserting their authority.

In the Goram Islands, the author notes the islanders' heavy reliance on the trepang and wax trade with Banda, as well as their advanced skills in shipbuilding. He laments the fact that only a small portion of this lucrative trade is actually enjoyed by Dutch settlements, with much of it controlled by outside traders.

The author then turns his attention back to the Arru Islands, where he addresses issues such as the poverty of the Christian teacher-missionaries stationed there and the need to formally appoint new village chiefs. He oversees the installation of a new Upper Orang Kaya on the island of Wokan.

A key observation in this chapter is the author's concern over the active slave trade occurring within the Arru and surrounding islands. While acknowledging the natives' somewhat different cultural perspective on the practice, the author expresses his desire to see the abolition of this trade under a renewed Dutch colonial framework.

Overall, the chapter reinforces the author's view of the commercial and strategic importance of these island groups to the Dutch, while also underscoring the social and administrative challenges that must be overcome to fully reintegrate them into the colonial system.
