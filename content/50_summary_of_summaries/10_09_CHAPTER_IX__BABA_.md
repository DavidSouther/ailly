Here is a summary of Chapter IX. Baba:

The chapter describes the author's visit to the island of Baba, where he encounters a deeply divided and suspicious native population. The island is split between two warring tribes, with the western inhabitants professing Christianity while the eastern tribe remains pagan.

Upon the author's arrival, the Baba natives initially flee in fear, only slowly gaining the confidence to approach the Dutch ship. The author works to dispel their distrust and gain their cooperation, distributing gifts from the government and formally installing new village chiefs.

The author notes the poverty and primitive living conditions of the Baba islanders, who rely primarily on fishing and gathering wild foods. He also observes their antiquated weapons, such as bows and arrows, and the general lack of development compared to other islands visited.

The chapter recounts a tragic incident in which an English trading vessel was attacked and looted by the more hostile eastern tribe of Baba, highlighting the dangers faced by foreigners in these unruly territories. The author is unable to fully resolve the long-standing feuds between the two native factions.

Overall, the visit to Baba underscores the challenges of reintegrating such isolated and antagonistic populations under Dutch authority. The chapter portrays the island as a stark example of the costs of the Dutch colonial withdrawal and the difficulty of reasserting control over such fractious native societies.
