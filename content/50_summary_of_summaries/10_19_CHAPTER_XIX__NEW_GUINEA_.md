Here is a summary of Chapter XIX: New Guinea:

This chapter recounts the author's voyage and attempted exploration of the southern coast of New Guinea. After departing the Arru Islands, he sails southwest towards the Bartholomeus River on the New Guinea coast.

He describes the difficulties of approaching the low, swampy coastline due to mud flats extending far out, preventing his ship from getting close. The author sends out boats to try to make landings, spotting scattered villages and human activity on shore.

In one area, the chapter vividly recounts a tense encounter where hostile naked natives in canoes approach the ship, behaving erratically. The author tries gifting them to establish friendly contact, but the natives attack with arrows after acting welcoming initially.

The author's party is unable to go ashore safely in this region. He then sails east along the coast, continuing to spot Native dwellings at points but unable to land due to shallows and aggression from coastal tribespeople.

Finally, the author lands at an uninhabited bay on a small island off the New Guinea coast. He interacts cautiously with a party of tribesmen led by an elderly chief.

Though tantalizing brief details about the mysterious Papuan natives are recorded, the chapter portrays the author's exploration of this uncharted New Guinea coast as extremely hazardous and limited in achievements due to the vessels' inability to make meaningful contact inland.
