Here is a summary of Chapter XIX. New Guinea:

This chapter describes the author's initial exploration of the southern coast of New Guinea, focusing on the area around the St. Bartholomews River. The author faces significant difficulties in approaching the coast, which is characterized by extensive mudflats and shallow waters that prevent the brig from getting close to shore.

Despite numerous attempts, the author is unable to make direct contact with the native inhabitants, who flee at the sight of the ship and its boats. He does manage to enter and partially explore the Dourga River, which he names after his vessel, but is forced to turn back due to the health concerns of his crew.

The chapter provides detailed nautical observations about the treacherous nature of the coastal waters and the hazards that vessels face in attempting to navigate this region. The author notes the complete lack of sheltered anchorages or secure landing points along the stretch of coastline he surveys.

Encounters with the native population are limited, but the author is struck by their hostility and primitive appearance, describing them as tall, black-skinned people with tightly curled hair who respond with threatening gestures and retreat rapidly into the dense forests when approached.

Overall, the chapter conveys the author's growing frustration at his inability to establish meaningful contact with the inhabitants of this inhospitable region, even as he dutifully carries out his instructions to explore and chart the coast. It foreshadows the more violent clash that will occur in the following chapter.
