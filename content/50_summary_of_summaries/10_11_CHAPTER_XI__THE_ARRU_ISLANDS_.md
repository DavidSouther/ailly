Here is a summary of Chapter XI. The Arru Islands:

The chapter continues the author's examination of the Arru Islands, focusing on the commercial activities and dynamics among the native population and visiting traders.

The author provides detailed descriptions of the various types of trepang (sea cucumber) found in the Arru waters and the complex system of grading and pricing these valuable products. He notes the Arafuras' reliance on the trepang trade as a major source of income and the role of Bughis and Macassar traders in exploiting this lucrative resource.

The author also discusses the pearl fishery on the island of Vorkay, describing the dangerous diving operations conducted by the Arafuras to extract the pearls. He laments the decline of this industry since the withdrawal of direct Dutch control and oversight.

The chapter highlights the Arafuras' general subservience to the Christian populations on the western islands, who assert a degree of authority and tax-collecting privileges over the heathen interior tribes. The author sees this as a model for reestablishing Dutch influence, by working through the Christianized coastal communities.

Overall, the chapter provides an in-depth look at the economic and social dynamics of the Arru Islands, underscoring both the commercial potential and the challenges of reintegrating these remote territories under a coherent Dutch colonial framework.
