AUTHOR'S PREFACE.

A plain preface will be best adapted for a simple narrative of events
that occurred and observations made during Voyages through important
countries, with a portion of which we were previously unacquainted,
while the remainder have been but rarely visited. I was repeatedly
requested by relatives and friends, both in India and in the Mother
Country, to communicate these to the Public, as being information that
would be deemed useful and important, not only by Government and Naval
officers, but by every inquiring Netherlander. This encouragement
induced me, who, being a seaman, cannot aspire to literary renown, to
employ my leisure hours in compiling the following unadorned narrative
of my voyages through the Southern parts of the Archipelago of the
Moluccas, and along the South-west coast of New Guinea.

If the hopes I have cherished as to the importance of the information
here given be not without ground, I trust that I shall not demand in
vain the indulgence of my honoured Readers, which I am sure will be
readily granted when it is taken into consideration, that the continued
fatigues I endured, not only while engaged in performing the voyages
here described, but also while employed in the expedition against
Celebes in 1824, have undermined and broken my constitution. The
confidence with which the Government honoured me by entrusting to me
the execution of these voyages of examination, was certainly a spur
which incited me to overcome all difficulties, and to make myself as
useful as possible to my country.

With the assistance of my officers and of intelligent natives, I was
fortunately enabled to collect accurate details concerning numerous
islands and coasts, which I subsequently laid down in a chart, and
forwarded it to the Government, a correct copy of which, on a smaller
scale, I offer to my reader, as an illustration to the narrative.

If I have succeeded in effecting the object for which this volume is
offered to the Public, I shall consider the time and trouble bestowed
upon its compilation as being richly rewarded.

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

The numerous islands lying between the Moluccas and the northern coasts
of Australia, have hitherto been very little known to the world;
indeed, we cannot discover that any account of them has yet been made
public, with the exception of some observations in Valentyn's "Oude en
Nieuw Oost Indien," a work published in Holland more than a century
ago:--we are, therefore, induced to offer a few particulars concerning
their early history, as an introduction to M. Kolff's narrative.

We cannot discover that these islands were ever visited by Europeans
previous to 1636, in which year Pieter Pieterson, a Dutch navigator,
touched at the Arru Islands during his voyage to examine the northern
coasts of Australia, which had been discovered thirty years previously
by a small Dutch vessel, called the _Duyfken_. Six years subsequently
the Arru group was again visited by F. Corsten, when several of
the native chiefs were induced to acknowledge the supremacy of the
Dutch East India Company, binding themselves to trade with no other
Europeans, and investing them with the monopoly of the pearl banks,
the produce of which the Dutch conveyed to Japan, and there found a
ready market and a lucrative return. Transactions, with similar views,
subsequently took place at the adjacent islands, on which small bodies
of troops were placed, to whose control the simple natives willingly
submitted, and viewed with indifference the destruction of the spice
trees, which were vigorously sought for and up-rooted by the new comers.

As it was the object of the Dutch to restrict the trade in spices
within narrow limits, in order to enhance the value of this commodity,
of which they enjoyed the monopoly, the East India Company did not
permit even their own countrymen to carry on a commercial intercourse
with these islands; indeed, the only advantages the Company derived
from their possession, consisted in their affording slaves to cultivate
the clove and nutmeg plantations of Banda and Amboyna, the only
settlements in which they allowed spices to be grown. Notwithstanding
these restrictions, an extensive contraband trade was carried on with
the islands; for the Europeans who were, from time to time, encouraged
by the Company to settle in the Moluccas as planters, although
receiving bounties in the shape of free grants of land, with advances
of slaves and provisions on credit and at original cost, under the sole
condition that they should supply the Company with the produce at a
fixed price, soon abandoned their plantations, and embarked in the more
exciting and lucrative trade with the islands to the southward, sending
confidential slaves in charge of their prahus.[1] It is recorded, that
many individuals collected enormous fortunes by this traffic, which,
indeed, was nearly all profit, as the goods sent there were of very
small value. The trepang fishery, now the principal source of wealth
to these islands, then scarcely existed, and the return cargoes of the
prahus consisted chiefly of less bulky articles, such as amber, pearls,
tortoise-shell and birds-of-paradise.

Towards the close of the last century, when the rigorous monopoly of
the Dutch had induced other natives to produce spices, which were
cultivated with success by the French in the Isle of Bourbon, and by
the English on the west coast of Sumatra, the Moluccas began to decline
in importance, and with a view to reduce government expenditure, the
Dutch withdrew their military establishments from the islands to the
southward. The Bughis, an enterprising people from the southern part
of the island of Celebes, and Chinese merchants from Java and Macassar,
immediately engrossed the trade with the islands:--the wars which broke
out in Europe about this time affording them great encouragement, since
the Dutch, sufficiently occupied in maintaining their more important
possession, could offer little interruption. The British, during their
short occupation of the Moluccas, were so exclusively occupied by the
immediate affairs of newly-acquired settlements, that the countries
beyond their limits were, in a great measure, neglected; indeed, the
inhabitants of some of the more remote islands were not aware that the
Moluccas had changed masters; the Dutch flags left among them many
years previously, being still hoisted on festive occasions.

When Java and its dependencies were restored to Dutch dominion after
the peace of 1814, their East India Company had ceased to exist; the
Government, however, continued to monopolize the traffic with the
Moluccas. The Chinese merchants of Java and Macassar had, by this time,
embarked largely in the trade with the Arru and Serwatty Islands;
several brigs and large prahus, manned with Javanese, but having
Chinese supercargoes, annually resorting to them from Sourabaya, and
the other commercial ports to the westward.

Christianity, the seeds of which had been sown by the Dutch during
their occupation of the islands, also began to spread among the
inhabitants, and the native Amboynese teachers, who established
themselves in some of the chief villages, were encouraged rather than
molested by the Bughis and Chinese traders, these perceiving that their
interests would be promoted by any advance the natives might make in
civilization. The Bughis, unlike the Malayan and Ceramese Mohammedans,
care little about making proselytes; neither do the Chinese feel much
inclination to obtain converts to their half atheistical creed, which
they themselves seem disposed to ridicule.

The founding of Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles, in the year 1819,
forms an important era in the history of the Indian Archipelago.
The liberality of the institutions adopted there gave an impulse
to commerce and civilization throughout the Eastern Seas, and even
the most distant and barbarous tribes have not been excluded from
participation in the general improvement. Among the first to avail
themselves of this new state of affairs, were the enterprising Bughis
tribes of Celebes, who flocked to Singapore by thousands, delighted
at the favourable opportunity offered them for disposing of their
produce to Europeans and Chinese merchants, without being subjected to
extortionate imposts, or the annoyances of custom-house officers, which
had hitherto checked their enterprize.

The islands in the eastern part of the Archipelago were, however,
too distant from this emporium for the natives to partake of the
benefits it offered, in an equal degree with those of the countries
more adjacent. The greater portion of the produce afforded by the Arru
and neighbouring islands, was collected and brought by the Bughis to
Celebes, where it was re-shipped for Singapore; at least twelve months
being required to send the goods to market and receive the returns.

It was chiefly to establish an intercourse with the natives of these
parts, by presenting to them a more convenient mart for their produce,
that a British settlement was formed on Melville Island, near the coast
of Australia, in 1824, by Captain, now, Sir J.J. Gordon Bremer, and if
this, and the settlement subsequently formed at Raffles Bay, proved
unsuccessful, it is more to be attributed to our want of information
concerning these islands than to any other cause. Two small vessels
successively were sent among them by the authorities of Melville
Island, neither of which returned. It will be seen by M. Kolff's
narrative, that, unhappily, both these vessels directed their course to
parts previously unvisited by foreigners, and that the natives, unable
to resist the temptation of acquiring more valuable property than they
had ever before contemplated, attacked and plundered them, killing the
greater portion of their crews. Had they visited the parts of these
islands which were frequented by the traders, they might have done so
with comparative safety, as the natives there would have been too well
aware of the value of commerce to risk the danger of putting a stop to
it by an action likely to draw upon them the vengeance of a powerful
people.

From M. Kolff's voyage having been undertaken so soon after our
occupation of Melville Island, there is some reason to believe, that
the formation of that settlement had considerable influence in inducing
the Dutch Government suddenly to take a deep interest in the islands
adjacent to it, which had been almost totally neglected for half a
century previously. Whether this voyage was beneficial or otherwise to
the British interest in that quarter the reader will be able to judge
from the work itself, but, at all events, we have to thank M. Kolff
for information which cannot but be valuable, now that we are about
to found another settlement in that part of the world; H.M. ships
_Alligator_ and _Britomart_, again under the command of Sir Gordon
Bremer, being on their voyage to the northern coast of Australia for
the purpose. The arrangement of the work for publication has afforded
the Translator occupation and amusement during a long voyage, and he
trusts it may be the means of conveying useful information concerning a
simple and industrious people, occupying a number of richly productive
islands, in the immediate vicinity of a continent which may be
considered a vast British colony, and with whom his countrymen may open
an intercourse likely to prove advantageous to both parties.

VOYAGES

OF THE

DUTCH BRIG DOURGA,

&c. &c.

CHAPTER I.

EXPEDITIONS IN THE MOLUCCA AND JAVA SEAS.

Outward Voyage.--Tristan D'Acunha.--English Settlement.--Expedition
in the Molucca Seas.--Voyage to Palembang and Banka.--Fidelity of
Javanese Seamen.--Expedition to Macassar.--Particulars concerning the
Macassar War.

As an introduction to the narrative, I will communicate to the reader
a short account of my outward voyage to India, and of the various
expeditions in which I was engaged previous to undertaking the voyage
to the eastern parts of the Indian Archipelago, which forms the subject
of this volume.

In January 1817, I was appointed by the Minister of Marine to the
corvette _Venus_, Commander B.W.A. Van Schuler, then lying in the Niewe
Diep, ready for sea on a voyage to Batavia. On the 28th of the same
month we sailed, under a salute of the guns, and having sent away the
pilot with parting letters to our friends, we stood out to sea, the
shores of our beloved country soon fading from view.

Remarkable events seldom occurring during the outward voyage, a few
words will suffice to give an account of our proceedings. In the month
of April we arrived off Tristan D'Acunha, and having espied a number of
huts on the shores of a bay on the north side of the island, we stood
towards them, and anchored in twenty-five fathoms, tolerably close to
the land. When viewed from a distance the island has the appearance of
a single high mountain, the sides rising abruptly out of the sea. The
bay in which we anchored lies open to the sea, and therefore can afford
no shelter to vessels. Its shores were steep and lined with alternate
patches of sand and rock, against which the sea beat with great
violence. The snow-white foam of the surf, glittering in the sun-beams,
contrasted strikingly with the soft green of the uplands; the charming
prospect this afforded being embellished by a beautiful waterfall
tumbling into the sea from the hills above.

The English establishment, which had been fixed here a short time
previous to our visit, consisted of seventy-four men, with their wives,
under the command of Major Kloete, the settlement being a dependance of
the Cape of Good Hope. It had already made great progress, agriculture
being carefully attended to; and among other vegetables we were
delighted to find an abundance of excellent potatoes. The industrious
and orderly habits of these settlers, coupled with their civility
towards strangers, of which we had evidence in the friendly reception
we met with, entitled them to every praise. This settlement, however,
now no longer exists.

After our departure from Tristan D'Acunha we encountered a severe gale,
in which we lost two topmasts, the foremast and bowsprit. Lieutenant
Vendoren with seven seamen also fell overboard, and the former only was
saved. On the 29th of June we arrived at Batavia, and after a short
stay there, departed for the populous town of Sourabaya to refit our
damaged vessel.

The first expedition in which we were engaged was directed against
Ceram and Sapanua, where some serious disturbances had taken place. On
the 22nd of February 1818 we obtained a decided victory over the Sultan
Muda of Batjoli in the Moluccas, for which I believe, our commander, M.
Van Schuler, was made Knight of the third class of the Military Order
of William.

During the whole of the year 1818, we were employed in cruizing among
the Molucca Islands, for the prevention of piracy and the contraband
trade, especially the illegal sale of gunpowder to the natives in
a state of insurrection. The pirates sometimes behave with great
boldness, deriving confidence from the rapidity with which their
light vessels can escape into the numerous creeks; the oars which
they use when the wind is contrary giving them great advantages in
point of swiftness over our cruizers. A couple of steam-boats, which
would be able to follow them into their lurking places, would be very
efficacious in ridding us of these plagues.

On the 12th of January 1819, the then Governor of the Moluccas, General
De Kock, with his family, embarked on board the _Venus_ for the purpose
of being conveyed to Java. We sailed on the following day, and did
not reach Batavia until the 4th of May following. During this tedious
passage, a beautiful collection of the birds of the Moluccas, the
property of the General, died from want of food. Salt meat and biscuit
formed our sole diet during the greater part of the voyage, and it is
surprising that with such provisions, we did not have considerable
sickness on board.

We now proceeded to Sourabaya, being accompanied by Captain Stout,
of the Colonial Marine, with several light vessels. When off the
Taggal Mountain we encountered some piratical vessels, and having been
several times employed with native seamen, speaking their language with
tolerable fluency, I was placed in charge of a Korra-korra, and sent
in chase. Captain Stout met with a sad accident on this occasion. A
gun that had been fired by the Captain himself, perhaps from its being
overloaded, recoiled so much that it burst through the bulwarks on the
opposite side of the vessel and fell overboard, striking the Captain
violently on the breast during its passage, and causing the almost
immediate death of this brave seaman.

In the latter part of the year 1819, the _Venus_ was placed in
readiness to return to the mother country. Our joyful expectations,
however, were soon disappointed, for the disturbances which had broken
out at Palembang, rendered it necessary that the corvette should
proceed there, to be in readiness to act against the Sultan Mohammed
Badr-el-Din; and on the 4th of December we arrived in the roads of
Minto, on the island of Banka, to await the time when our services
would be required.

All prospects of a speedy return home were thus destroyed, but
I consoled myself with the consideration that duty required the
sacrifice, and that I could serve my country in these remote regions as
well as in the Netherlands. Our foreign possessions, indeed, though far
distant, are still provinces of the fatherland.

Actuated by these considerations, I willingly accepted the offer made
to our junior officers to enter the Colonial Navy, and receive the
command of a gun-boat armed with an 18-pounder, two 8-pounders, some
swivels, and manned with thirty men, chiefly Javanese, the same rank
being given me with that I held in the Royal Navy. I was now sent
to the east coast of Banka, for the purpose of keeping the pirates
in check, and of keeping open the communication with the tin mines.
At first I was accompanied by the schooner _Zeemeeuw_, Lieutenant
Alewyn, but this vessel was soon ordered on another station, and
I remained here eight months, in daily contact with the pirates,
without the assistance of other Europeans; this period forming by
no means the most agreeable portion of my stay in India. I had often
serious engagements with the famed Radin Allin, who, however, never
was courageous enough to board the gun-boat. Had he done so, our only
resource would have been to blow up our vessel, to prevent her falling
into the hands of the pirates, as the great superiority of their force
would have rendered it impossible to withstand them. This Radin Allin
displayed great intrepidity on several occasions. Once, while I was
conveying some vessels to Kaba, he took advantage of my absence to
attack and carry the fort of Batu-Rusa, on the Marawang river. On my
return I found him still in the river with a large number of prahus,
where I blockaded him until the month of September 1820, when I at
length received assistance from Minto, at a period when such relief had
become of the greatest necessity, as I had often thought that my last
hour had arrived. Of my crew, only a few natives remained, the others
having either been killed or sent to the hospital.

During these hazardous expeditions I had frequent opportunities of
witnessing the fidelity of the Javanese seamen in the hour of danger.
Their behaviour and disposition prepossessed me very much in favour of
the nation to which they belonged, and during my subsequent voyaging
in India, where I considerably increased my acquaintance with them,
I never had occasion to alter the favourable opinion I had formed.
When a Javanese is treated with consideration, and is not subjected to
tyrannical treatment, he is as much to be trusted as an European, and
submits far more readily to control.

The force which came to my relief consisted of several vessels under
the command of Lieutenant Colonel Keer, destined to act against the
chiefs of the rebels, Radin Allin and Radin Kling, and I now obtained
permission to return to Minto. In the beginning of 1821, I departed
thence for Sourabaya, with the view of having the gun-boat repaired, as
it was ordered to take part in the expedition which during that year
re-established our authority at Palembang. The particulars of that
renowned expedition being still fresh in the memory of my readers, I
will give no circumstantial account of our proceedings, but I will
relate a few occurrences in which I was personally engaged. After
the first attack, when our fleet had retired to its former position,
it was my good fortune to rescue Lieutenant Boerhave and his men,
together with the crew of another gun-boat, both of which had fallen
into the hands of the enemy; and on the following 24th of June, during
the second assault, the gun-boat under my command opened the way
through the strong barricade erected across the river to the attack
of the great floating battery, on which I was the first to plant the
Netherlands flag. As a token of particular approbation on the part
of the Government for this deed, three of my small crew received the
decoration of the military order of William.

After the termination of this renowned expedition, which ended in
the entire conquest of the kingdom of Palembang, I received orders
to accompany General De Kock to Batavia. In the month of August
I was appointed to the schooner _Calypso_, which circumstance I
only mention for the purpose of rendering a just tribute to the
meritorious character of Lieutenant Sondervan her commander. In this
vessel I passed the entire year 1822, making several voyages in her,
circumnavigating Java, and visiting the mines of Sambas and Pontiana,
in Borneo. M. Tobias, the commissioner for our establishments in
Borneo, was on board the schooner the greater portion of the time. The
agreeable society of this gentleman, coupled with the unbroken harmony
that prevailed among us, rendered these voyages extremely pleasant,
notwithstanding the hardships and fatigues we underwent. We made
several journeys into the interior of Borneo, and inspected the mines
of the Chinese, which are here very numerous. I will not particularise
the voyages I subsequently undertook to Banka, Sumatra, and many other
of our possessions, which I performed with pleasure, as they gave me
many opportunities of gathering information concerning these countries
and their native inhabitants.

Having thus passed a considerable time in India, without experiencing
the lassitude of which Europeans in that part of the world so generally
complain, I was appointed adjutant to my former chief, Captain Van
Schuler, who had now become Commandant and Director of the Colonial
Marine. Although I was much pleased by the honourable notice with which
my brave chief favoured me, I soon became tired of an idle life at
Batavia. I had been so long accustomed to the navigation of these seas,
that I could not refrain from soliciting the Governor General, Van Der
Capellen, to place me again in active service.

While performing a journey overland from Batavia to Sourabaya in
company with Captain Van Schuler, I took the opportunity of visiting
Bantjar, in the district of Rembang, where I saw the beautiful frigate
_Javaan_, with several brigs and schooners, then in the course of
construction for the Colonial Navy.[2] The command of one of these was
promised to me on this occasion. I will pass over the description of
this part of Java, as being unconnected with the object of the work. We
met with few occurrences worthy of remark, for I do not consider our
adventure in crossing the Sumadang Mountains, where our carriage was
overturned, of sufficient importance to detain me in my narrative.

On my return to Batavia I was promoted to a Lieutenancy of the first
class in the Colonial Marine, and at my urgent request was suffered
to throw up my appointment as Adjutant, when I was invested with the
command of H.M. Brig _Dourga_,[3] with orders to ship a crew, and
fit her out in readiness to accompany the Governor General on his
expedition to the Moluccas in 1824. So recently promoted, invested
with a new command, and about to become a fellow-voyager with his
Excellency, it will readily be conceived that my zeal was of the
strongest, and that I exerted myself to the utmost to show myself
worthy of the favours that had been conferred upon me.

After remaining a considerable time at Amboyna, a settlement
distinguished by the courtesy and hospitality of its European
inhabitants, we sailed for Banda in the train of the Governor General,
(who was embarked in the frigate _Eurydice_), where we arrived on the
18th of April. The Gunung Api volcano was in a state of violent action
at the time, filling the atmosphere with fire and smoke, the volumes of
the latter being ejected with such force, that their collision caused
constant vivid flashes of lightning, accompanied by a rumbling noise
like that of thunder. This outbreak of nature was indescribably fine
and majestic, and is memorable for having formed a new crater in the
north-west side of the mountain. The town of Banda, remained, however,
uninjured.

From Banda we sailed for Sapanua, an island well known from the war
which took place there in 1817, and I subsequently proceeded to Menado
and Macassar, where I took part in the expedition called forth by the
war that had broken out in Celebes.

The mode of warfare which obtains among the Macassars, differs
considerably from that adopted by the other natives of the Archipelago,
than whom they are more wealthy and better armed, while at the same
time they take the lead in cleverness and ferocity. When under their
own chiefs, they are not remarkable for shewing that courage which
is commonly ascribed to them, especially to the Bughis, this being
displayed rather upon the sea than on land. They will rarely stand
firm against the attacks of regular troops in the field, but fight
well from ambuscades or from behind entrenchments. Their arms consist
of very good guns, manufactured by themselves, with spears, krisses,
klewangs and lelahs.[4] The chiefs and head warriors wear armour, made
of plaited iron or copper wire, which they call baju-ranti or chain
shirt: it will resist a thrust from the klewang or kriss, but affords
no protection against a musket ball.

In the southern parts of Celebes, horses of a very good description
are to be met with, which the natives manage with considerable skill.
A cushion stuffed with cotton, and laid upon the animal's back, forms
their saddle, on which they sit cross-legged, and with this simple
contrivance their seat is so firm that they take bold leaps, and scour
across the country in a manner truly surprising. When a chief is
killed, his relatives and slaves do not care to survive, but a case of
this sort rarely takes place, as the former usually remain on spots
free from danger. The Bughis will carry their slain off the field of
battle at every risk, and will submit to great loss rather than fail
in this object. It is difficult, however, to draw them into making an
assault _en masse_.

We anchored off the town of Macassar on the 5th of July, 1824, the
king of the northern part of the state of which this is the capital,
having by this time followed the example of the Bughis of Boni in
rising against our government. On the 14th of the same month we sailed
for Tannette, (a town on the west coast of Celebes,) with troops and
munitions of war, our vessel forming part of a flotilla consisting
of the brigs Sirene, Nautilus, Jacoba-Elizabeth, and Dourga, with
the corvette Courier, two gun-boats, and some prahus with native
auxiliaries; the naval force being under the orders of Commander Buys,
while the troops were led by Lieutenant Colonel De Steurs. Having
assembled before Tannette, we formed into line and cannonaded the
enemy's fortification, while at the same time the troops were landed
and some gained possession of the forts and villages, together with
some strongholds farther up the country. The loss on our side was
small, but the enemy suffered greatly in killed and wounded. After
sustaining this defeat, the king retired into the interior, and refused
to submit. On the 22nd, Colonel De Steurs departed with the troops
towards Macassar, with the intention of chastising the treacherous
inhabitants of Labakang and Pankalina, those towns lying in the route.
The squadron followed their march along the coast, with the view of
affording assistance should it be required. The number of reefs and
banks render the navigation of the coast hazardous and difficult; but
the fishermen of the islands piloted us through them with safety.
During the passage our armed boats were constantly employed on the
coasts, more for the purpose of checking the plundering propensities
displayed by our native allies from Goa, than for the annoyance of
the enemy. Plunder, indeed, seemed to be the chief object of these
auxiliaries, for when they were required to fight, they either remained
idle or took to their heels.

On the 24th we reached Macassar, the inhabitants of the intermediate
coast having speedily been brought under subjection. The expedition had
been fortunate and successful in every respect, and inspired us with
so much confidence that we eagerly desired to be again led against the
enemy.

An expedition consisting of 200 troops, under the command of
Lieutenant-colonel Reder, was now set on foot to attack the Raja of
Supa, the squadron being again employed in conveying them to their
destination. On the 4th of August we anchored in the bay of Supa, and
as the enemy obstinately refused to negociate, no other course remained
for us than to land the troops, and prepare to carry into effect the
orders of our Government. It immediately became apparent that the
resources of the enemy had been incorrectly reported to us, and that
more difficulty would be experienced in reducing the place than we had
been led to believe would have been the case.

Supa, the capital, is extended near the shore on the north-east side
of the bay, and is difficult of approach from seaward. The town, which
lies low, is bounded on the south side by extensive rice fields, while
to the south-west, in which direction the squadron lay, it is separated
from the sea by a ridge of hills.

On the morning after our arrival, the troops, with detachments of
seamen from the ships, were landed in good order under cover of the
guns of the squadron. Our attack upon the well-fortified town of Supa
was unsuccessful, the troops being driven back to the hills, of which,
however, they maintained possession; the enemy returning into the
town, with the exception of a number of horsemen, who remained at the
foot of the hills, and some detachments which took up positions to the
southward. Towards evening some mortars and brass six-pounders were
landed, and placed in battery against the town. The firing was at first
attended with little loss on either side, but the war-cries of the
Bughis convinced us that they were assembled in great force.

Repeated attempts were now made to set fire to the strongholds of the
enemy, but they were unsuccessful, and attended with considerable loss.
The vessels employed in keeping up the communication with Macassar had
by this time brought a number of native auxiliaries furnished by the
king of Sidenreng, but these took up a position to the southward, and
never emerged from their hiding places.

Information which was now received of our garrisons at Pankalina and
Labakang, consisting of sixty men each, having been overpowered and
massacred to a man, spread dismay and dejection among the troops,
while, through the weak indulgence of our commandant, military
discipline was often disregarded, and our operations consequently, were
deficient in point of combination. A second general assault was not
determined on until the men had been wearied by useless skirmishing.
All the men that could be spared from the ships were now ordered on
shore, and on this as on the previous occasion I served with them; the
command of the left wing of the battery being entrusted to me, while
the right was under the direction of Commander Buys.

At daylight on the 14th, after our batteries had for some time played
with vigour on the town, Lieutenant-colonel Reder advanced to the
attack with one hundred and fifty soldiers, one hundred seamen, and
forty marines, whom the enemy allowed to approach close under the wall
without firing a shot. Their cavalry had in the meantime been posted
out of sight on the south side of the town, and when our troops had
reached the walls, and commenced a sharp combat with those within,
the cavalry fell upon them in flank, penetrated right through them,
and even close up to our breast-works. The confusion created by this
movement was so great, that notwithstanding the efforts of the officers
the flight soon became general, and the disorder communicating itself
to the reserve, the enemy were enabled to cause us considerable loss.
The superior courage of Europeans soon, however, restored matters to
order, for the fire of case-shot from our batteries checked the career
of the enemy, and our troops having by this time rallied became the
assailants in their turn, and drove the Bughis back to their batteries.
Our advantage over the enemy was limited to this, so that our attack
was attended with much bloodshed without being successful. We had
to lament the loss of two brave officers, Lieutenants Van Pelt and
Bannhoff, together with nearly one-third of the men engaged, six of my
own crew being killed on this fatal occasion. During the engagement our
auxiliaries remained in the positions they had taken up, and did not
stir a foot to assist us.

On the evening after this occurrence we were joined by Mr. Tobias,
the commissioner, Colonel De Steurs, and the Raja of Sidenreng, the
latter bringing with him a number of native auxiliaries. The arrival
of Colonel De Steurs gave great joy to our troops, this officer being
universally beloved and esteemed, but of what avail was his presence
now that the pith of our force had been expended in ill-directed
attacks? The enemy occasionally made night attacks on our position, but
were always driven back, our auxiliaries showing on these occasions
more courage than usual, repeatedly pursuing their adversaries close up
to their forts.

On the 22nd, the frigate _Eurydice_ joined the squadron, when a portion
of her crew, with two long eighteen-pounders and some Congreve rockets
were landed; the latter, however, did not answer our expectations
upon trial. Our endeavours to gain an advantage over the enemy were
still unattended by success, and our leader, seeing our force daily
diminished by useless skirmishes, determined on making another general
attack. Every body that could be spared from the ships, natives as
well as Europeans, were landed to join in the assault, the attacking
force now amounting to three hundred men, exclusive of the auxiliaries,
who could not be brought into motion. Our batteries had made several
breaches in the enemy's breast-works, but these had always been
repaired during the following night.

The general attack, which took place early in the morning, was
conducted with much bravery. The road to the town was studded with
sharp stakes, by which many of our people suffered severely. The
enemy in the meantime remained within their entrenchments, protecting
themselves from our shot by sitting in holes dug in the ground; and
on our advancing up to them they fought with desperation, surrounding
their wives and children, and determining to die to the last man rather
than surrender. Our troops were sometimes engaged hand to hand with
the enemy, who opposed our bayonets and swords with their _krisses_
and _klewangs_. At length Colonel De Steurs, finding that many of our
men, with a captain and a first lieutenant, had fallen, determined
to draw off our small body of heroes, with the intention of renewing
the attack with the reserve; but this was found impracticable, as the
latter, which consisted only of a small number of seamen from the
frigate, had already sustained considerable loss. The retreat was
therefore sounded, and thus, for the fourth time, had our efforts
proved unavailing. On this occasion, also, one-third of the attacking
force was placed _hors de combat_. We were, nevertheless, convinced
that had a correct report been given to the government of the force
of the enemy, and had our proceedings been conducted with order and
regularity, the victory must infallibly have been on our side. It is
a consolation, however, to know, that although the enemy maintained
their position, they experienced, in a forcible manner, the superiority
of our courage; for notwithstanding the relaxation of discipline
which at first prevailed, no one can deny that our men displayed
much personal bravery. The expedition, although unsuccessful, had
therefore the effect of inspiring the people of Supa with a dread of
the Dutch arms. According to the account of trustworthy natives, their
loss had been very great; indeed, their successes never gave them
sufficient confidence to emerge from behind their entrenchments. We now
endeavoured to reduce them by a close blockade, but in this we were
also unsuccessful; and this object was not effected until six months
afterwards, when General Geer appeared before the place with a force
much greater than that employed on the previous occasion.

On the 6th of October, the squadron left Supa for Macassar, carrying
away the troops, with the exception of one hundred men, who were left
under the command of Captain Van Doornum. The brig under my command,
together with a gun-boat, also remained, and we were soon joined by
the corvette Courier. On the 20th, I sailed for Macassar, and two days
afterwards, when off Tannette, a number of prahus were seen standing
in towards the fort there, in which we had a garrison of fifty men. On
perceiving the brig the prahus altered their course and stood out to
sea, a proceeding which aroused my suspicion, and as the sea breeze
prevented me from following them, I ran in, and brought up off the
mouth of the river. A small prahu soon came alongside, bringing the
information that the fort was beset on the land side by the enemy, who
threatened an attack with so large a force that our small garrison
could not possibly resist. The commandant wished to embark his men in
the brig and desert the fort; but as I could not receive them without
having received orders to that effect from the governor, I sent one of
the small vessels that attended the brig to Macassar, to make known to
the authorities there the hazardous position we were in. It appeared
that the enemy intended to have attacked the fort both by sea and
land, in which case not one of the garrison would have escaped. My
accidental arrival had fortunately prevented this double attack, which
would not have been the case had I come a day later, or had I missed
the prahus, the appearance of which caused me to anchor off the fort.
I therefore thanked Providence for leading me to adopt the route which
brought me near the besieged place, the garrison of which, but for this
opportune visit, must have experienced the same fate with that which
had already befallen those of Labakang and Pankalina. On the following
day the brig Nautilus arrived to relieve us.

In the mean time the people of Boni had risen, all the tribes to
the northward of Macassar being now in arms against us. The town of
Macassar was often threatened by the enemy, but they never ventured
an attack, being deterred by the force our ally, the king of Goa, had
brought into the field, and by the reinforcements that arrived from
Java. Preparations were now made for a grand expedition, the troops
that had been left at Supa and Tannette being withdrawn from their
uncomfortable posts to join the main force at Macassar.

On the 1st of December I sailed for Sourabaya, the brig being in want
of repairs; and on the 19th of January, 1825, returned to Bonthian
Bay, on the south coast of Celebes. On the 10th of March, General Van
Geen arrived there with the frigate Javaan, and a number of vessels
large and small. The general was accompanied by the Panambahan,[5] of
Samanap, on the island of Madura, who brought with him a number of
native auxiliaries, paid and equipped at his own expense; the Raja of
Goa also furnishing a large number of men for the expedition, who were
armed by our government. The ships of war were attended by a number of
transports; so that the fleet presented a very imposing appearance.

On the 16th of March the fleet sailed from Bonthian Bay, and
passing through the straits of Salayer, entered the Bay of Boni,
without incurring injury from the numerous coral reefs that were
scattered along our route. A melancholy accident occurred soon after
our departure from Bonthian. A detachment of three officers and
ninety-three light infantry men, had been embarked on board a prahu,
totally unfitted for a transport. Some vessels having been perceived
by the people on deck, they called out that some pirates had hove
in sight, on which those who were below rushed up, and climbing on
one side of the vessel, capsized her, only the three officers and
thirty-three of the men being saved.

Our operations commenced at Sengey, where the troops were landed, and
the enemy not only driven helter-skelter out of their intrenchments,
but forced also to evacuate the neighbouring country. The portion of
our force which marched overland having joined us, we pushed forward
to Batjua, the capital of the kingdom of Boni, taking and destroying
the stockades of the enemy as we advanced. Batjua consists of a chain
of beautiful villages, defended by stockades erected in the water and
well provided with guns. It is considered as the seat of the court of
Boni, although the king resides about an hour and a half's journey in
the interior. Being the chief commercial depôt of the kingdom, the
trade is considerable. We found a large number of prahus here, the
greater number of which had been hauled up on the beach to prevent our
destroying them.

General Van Geen determined to effect a landing here, and the enemy
having been drawn away from the beach by a clever _ruse_, the troops
were put on shore without difficulty. The Boniers fled before the
advance of our courageous soldiers, sustaining great loss in their
retreat. The town was found to have been evacuated by the enemy,
although two-hundred pieces of cannon of small calibre were mounted on
the walls. The troops brought to the field by the Panambahan of Samanap
behaved very well in the attack. Notwithstanding their defeat, the
enemy obstinately refused to enter into negotiations with us.

The armed boats of the squadron were constantly employed in landing
the troops, and in attacking the batteries of the enemy. On one of
these occasions we had the misfortune to lose Lieutenant Alewyn, the
commander of the brig Siwa, an officer universally esteemed.

I will pass over in silence many other particulars of minor importance,
connected with this expedition. As the westerly monsoon was now drawing
to a close, and the number of our sick had become very great, we found
it impossible to pursue the enemy into the interior. Macassar had been
freed from danger, Supa had been taken, and the island of Celebes
placed in a state of more tranquillity; but not a single native chief
had been brought under the subjection of our government, so that the
expedition had produced no other useful effect than that of affording
a new proof of the total inability of the natives to withstand the
courage and military skill of Europeans.

On the departure of the fleet from the Bay of Boni, my brig, together
with the _Nautilus_ and the _Daphne_, sailed for Amboyna, touching
at Buton on the way, to obtain refreshments. Every ship that had
been employed had a large number of their men sick, one fifth only
of the crew of my brig being fit for duty. My officers and myself
also suffered much; indeed, on our arrival at Amboyna there was not a
healthy man on board. This prevalence of sickness is to be attributed
to the fatigues we had endured, and it should act as a warning to our
government to deter them from undertaking expeditions like these except
in cases of urgent necessity, or when they have very important objects
in view.

I will now proceed to give an account of the more agreeable duties
entrusted to my charge, which I was fortunate enough to carry into
execution to the satisfaction of the government, and within a tolerably
short period of time.

CHAPTER II.

TIMOR.

Object of the Voyage.--Sail for Timor.--Arrive at the Portuguese
Settlement of Dilli.--Poverty of the Inhabitants.--Mean
Reception.--Agriculture much neglected.--Slave Trade.--Symptoms of
Distrust on the Part of the Portuguese.--Discontented state of their
Native Subjects.--Departure for the Island of Wetta.

I was permitted by the Government to remain a considerable time at
Amboyna, as the greater part of the brig's crew were forced to enter
the hospital, while the vessel herself was in want of considerable
repair. The fine climate of this agreeable island, coupled with the
attendance of a skilful physician (M. Zengacker), soon restored my
brave crew to their former health and vigour, and the fresh air
of Batu Gadja, the residence of the much-respected governor, M.P.
Merkus, with the kind hospitality of its owner, soon caused me to
forget the fatigues and hardships I had undergone. When my health was
sufficiently restored to permit me to resume active duties, I made
preparations for a voyage to the Arru, Tenimber, and the other islands
lying between Great Timor and New Guinea, the conduct of which had
been entrusted to me by an order of the Government. These islands were
formerly possessions of our old East India Company, who had created
small forts on many of them, the better to secure to themselves the
entire trade in spices. Well known events connected with the state,
which undermined the monopoly of the East India Company, caused these
islands to decrease in importance, until at length the communication
with them ceased, and had continued so for a long series of years.
During the period in which the English had possession of the Moluccas
these islands were disregarded, so that their inhabitants were scarcely
aware that they had changed masters, and still continued to view
themselves as subjects of the Dutch, hoisting their flag on all festive
occasions. It is also a well-known fact, that at our factory in Japan
(thanks to the firm conduct of the chief, H. Doeff), our flag was never
hauled down; while the Dutch, therefore, ceased to exist as a nation,
our colours continued flying, and our authority acknowledged in several
of the remote possessions acquired by the courage and enterprize of
our forefathers. I trust we may again be actuated by the desire, not to
conquer new countries, but to maintain and increase our power in those
bequeathed to us by our ancestors.

With reference to the above-mentioned islands, the fifth article of
my instructions contained the following passage:--"And further, you
will inquire as to what remains exist of the forts erected by the East
India Company on the islands, especially on those of Arru, Tenimber,
and Kessa, noting down with correctness the particulars you may obtain
concerning them, subjoining your own observations on their positions,
and other points." A second object of my expedition was: "to kindle and
renew friendly relations with the natives, and to invite them to visit
Banda for the purpose of trading, this being an object of importance
to the islanders themselves, since they would there obtain the goods
they might require in exchange for their produce, on more advantageous
terms than from the traders who have hitherto supplied them." By my
instructions I was also requested, not only to note down answers to the
points of inquiry contained in them, but also to embody in a report any
observations I might make on subjects of importance to the Government,
that the information concerning these possessions might be as full as
possible.

M. Dielwaart, a gentleman in the employ of the Government, accompanied
me for the purpose of assisting in the examination; and M. Kam, a
clergyman, was also attached to the expedition, his object being to
promote the interests of Christianity, and to arrange all matters
connected with church affairs and public instruction. An interpreter
for the Malayan language, and another acquainted with the dialect
spoken by the mountaineers, were furnished to me, together with a guard
of seven soldiers.

On the 26th of May we sailed from Amboyna, and soon cleared the
bay--this being sometimes attended with much difficulty--when we
steered to the southward towards the town of Dilli, on the north-west
coast of Timor. Having to contend against squalls and contrary winds,
we did not reach the roads of Dilli until the 2nd of June. On arriving
outside the reefs which shelter the roads, we hove-to, and were boarded
by a Portuguese naval officer, who acted as harbour-master, and
conducted us into the inner roads by a narrow channel to the westward
of the town, which forms the only entrance. A ship may come to an
anchor outside the reefs, but the water is very deep, and she would be
quite unsheltered.

We found a large ship from Macao at anchor in the roads, but no other
vessel, not even a native prahu, was to be seen. After having anchored
we saluted the fort with thirteen guns, which the latter returned with
only eleven. On my demanding the reason of this deficiency, it was
attributed to the carelessness of the officer of artillery, for which
it appeared he was to be punished. Soon after entering the roads,
I sent Lieutenant Bruining on shore to inform the Governor of our
arrival. This gentleman having just retired to take his siesta, his
people had the incivility to allow M. Bruining to walk in front of the
house from noon until three o'clock, before being admitted into his
presence. The Governor expressed himself much gratified at our arrival,
and wished me to call upon him in the evening, when I went to his house
in company with several of the gentlemen who were embarked with me, and
experienced a more hospitable reception than could have been expected
from the poverty-stricken appearance of the place.

The Governor of the Portuguese possessions in the north coast of Timor
usually resides at Dilli, and pays himself and the other officials
out of the revenue derived from the trade. They are all engaged in
mercantile pursuits. Their pay, indeed, is extremely small, the
officers receiving only eleven guilders,[6] and the soldiers three
guilders per month. Their dwellings are miserable, dirty, and poor.

The Governor resides in a small wooden house situated at the back
of the fort, which contains no other furniture than a few tables,
benches, and old chairs. When dining at his house the following day,
we plainly perceived that the chairs, dishes, plates, and even the
table-linen, had been lent for the occasion by various individuals, all
being of different make and fashion; and our opinion on this point was
afterwards confirmed.

The Governor appeared to be much pleased on finding that I was in
want of some cattle and various articles, with which he offered to
supply me. He charged me seven dollars a head for the buffaloes, and
eighty-six guilders for half a picul (sixty-six pounds and a half) of
wax candles, that I purchased from him, in addition to which I paid
six per cent. export duty at the custom-house. Slaves were frequently
offered to me on sale, the Commandant, among others, wishing me to
purchase two children of seven or eight years of age, who were loaded
with heavy irons. The usual price of an adult male slave is forty
guilders, that of a woman or a child being from twenty-five to thirty.
These unfortunate people are kidnapped in the interior, and brought
to Dilli for sale, the Governor readily providing the vender with
certificates under his hand and seal, authorizing him to dispose of the
captives as he may think fit.[7]

In addition to the slave trade, from which the government officers
appeared to derive the greater part of their income, a commerce is
also earned on in wax and sandal-wood, which the natives are forced to
deliver up at a small, and almost nominal price. The trade is entirely
engrossed by the governor and officials, no other individual being
permitted to embark in commerce. This, with other abuses, caused so
much discontent, that many of the inhabitants of Dilli, both natives
and Chinese, expressed to me their strong desire to be freed from
the hateful yoke of the Portuguese. Scarcely had we anchored in the
roads, when several came on board the brig and gave vent to their joy,
supposing that we had come to take possession of the place.

The fort, a square inclosure, without bastions, containing within it
a house and a magazine, is constructed of stone and clay. Several
pieces of cannon are mounted on the walls, but the greater number are
unprovided with carriages. Some of our officers wished to inspect the
interior, but orders had been issued to the sentry not to allow us
to enter; at all events, our officers were refused admission on the
plea, that our visiting the fort would be viewed with displeasure by
the Governor. We did not think it worth while to make a formal request
for permission to visit this pitiful fortress, as the appearance of
the exterior gave us a good idea of what we might expect to meet with
inside.

Excepting the wife of the master of a merchant ship, we did not meet
with a single European woman here. Even those of the mixed breed were
scarce, two or three only being encountered by us during our stay.

When the Portuguese go abroad to pay a visit or to take the air, they
are carried by two or three slaves in a canvass hammock, suspended
from a bamboo pole, over which an awning is extended to protect the
rider from the sun and rain. There are excellent horses in the place,
but very little use is made of them, neither carts nor carriages
being employed by the inhabitants. The Portuguese, indeed, betray no
activity, and appear to have given themselves up to an indolent mode of
life, all their actions being redolent of laziness and apathy.

The population appeared to be numerous, but no signs of prosperity
were visible. The dwelling-houses, small, dirty and ruinous, and built
without order or symmetry, were scattered irregularly over the town.
On each side of the quarter inhabited by the Portuguese two redoubts
have been erected, on which some old iron guns of small calibre were
mounted. The sentinels were half naked, and their muskets were for the
most part without locks, so that they could only be carried for show.
In addition to their muskets they carried long poniards or daggers.

A large plain extended to the eastward of the town, on which appeared
an exceedingly high gallows. A short distance inland to the south-west
the chief of the native inhabitants resided, to whom I would willingly
have paid a visit, had it not been so much against the inclination of
the governor, who pretended that the chief was seriously indisposed.
A feeling of distrust on the part of the Portuguese was apparent
throughout our intercourse with them, and they evidently wished us to
hold no intercourse with the natives.

The land around the settlement is highly fertile, and fruit, which
here as in other parts of India, is produced without the assistance
of human industry, was plentiful; but culinary vegetables were very
scarce. The land would produce abundantly were the indolent Portuguese
to turn their attention to agriculture, or to encourage the natives
to do so; but they prefer seeing the innocent natives carried off
from their peaceful homes in the hills, that they may profit by their
sale, to allowing them to better their condition by their labour and
agricultural skill.

On two occasions some of the gentlemen of the settlement came off
to pay us a visit, appearing to be much surprised by the interior
arrangements of the brig. I had also invited the Governor, but he
made some trifling excuses for remaining on shore. Having thus doubly
requited the attention I experienced from these gentlemen, I made
preparations for my departure, and sent the Governor a present of a
thousand Manilla cigars, with a quantity of fishhooks, in return
for which he sent me off some sheep, and a number of shaddocks. We
therefore parted on the best terms.

Having now fulfilled the orders of the Governor of the Moluccas, we
weighed anchor on the 6th of June, and were piloted out by the same
lieutenant who had taken us into the roads. No fees being demanded, I
presented him with some provisions and trifles, which were received
with thanks. The day previous to our departure having been the birthday
of their king, a general promotion had taken place, by which this
gentleman had received the rank of first lieutenant, with a monthly
increase of pay of three guilders, his salary now amounting to fourteen
guilders per month.

The Portuguese possessions lie on the north side of Timor, and consist
of several small posts or factories, the principal of which are
Batu-Gede to the west, and Manatatu to the east of Dilli, the capital.
On the west and south-west sides of the island the Dutch settlements
are situated, the town of Coepang being the seat of the Residency.
As this part of Timor was beyond the limits of my intended voyage, I
steered a direct course from Dilli towards the Island of Wetta.

with the natives.--Destruction of the chief village.--Depart for

people of Kissa.

During the existence of the Dutch East India Company, a garrison of
their troops occupied the village of Sau, on the south coast of Wetta,
an island situated opposite the north coast of Timor. We directed our
course thither, and stood close along shore to search for the village
in question. The shores of the island were steep and hilly, but
luxuriantly clothed with trees, among which appeared at intervals the
huts of the inhabitants, the whole presenting a most picturesque view.
The natives appeared to be extremely shy, none of them making their
appearance on the beach, nor indeed seeming to wish to look at us.

On the 10th of June we arrived off Sau, and came to an anchor in fifty
fathoms water, about a cable's length from the shore, in a small bay,
where we lay tolerably well sheltered from the south-east winds by a
point of land. Having fired a gun, and hoisted the Dutch flag, two
natives made their appearance on the beach, to whom I sent one of
the interpreters, who soon brought them on board. They proved to be
Christian native chiefs, Hura, the Orang Kaya, and Dirk-Cobus, the
Orang Tua of the village.[8] Their appearance betokened great poverty,
and they complained bitterly of the miserable state into which they
had fallen since they had lost the protection of the Dutch. They
informed me that four years previously their village had been plundered
and burned to the ground, and several of their people killed, by the
inhabitants of Lette, since which occurrence they had deserted the
sea-coast, and had taken up their residence in the hills.

With the view of inspiring them with confidence, I went on shore
entirely alone, and landed near the remains of what had been a fine
walled village, containing a church and a guard-house. The number
of the fruit trees, and the luxuriant growth of the various plants,
gave evidence that the ground over which I walked possessed exceeding
fertility. A crowd of unconverted natives, who recognized the
above-mentioned Christian chiefs as their rulers, now joined us. They
were all armed with spears, bows, arrows, and _parangs_ or chopping
knives; but they soon laid these aside, and gave many tokens of
friendship and confidence. A small quantity of arrack and tobacco which
I distributed among them, put them in high spirits. With the exception
of the two chiefs, none of the natives spoke the Malayan language, nor
were my interpreters acquainted with their dialect.

On the beach I met with two sheds belonging to the people of Kissa, who
had been in the habit of coming here to barter cloth, iron and gold,
for sandal-wood, rice and Indian corn or maize. Coin is not in use as
a currency among the natives. Buffaloes, hogs, sheep and fowls may be
obtained here at a very cheap rate in exchange for cloth, but not in
very large numbers.

Having wandered for some time over this very beautiful country, we
approached the eastern extremity of the village, and sat down on
the banks of a river, which there emptied itself into the sea. They
appeared much pleased by this, and with much energy of manner expressed
their ardent desire to live once more in peace and quietude under the
rule of the Dutch, at the same time offering up thanks to heaven on
finding that the Company, (as they always styled our government) after
having so long abandoned them, had now again appeared. Although both
the chiefs spoke the Malayan language, I could not correctly understand
the answers to all the questions I put, but they clearly expressed
their desire to take up their residence again on the sea shore, and
requested that one or two European soldiers, with a teacher to instruct
them in the tenets of Christianity, might be left among them. For the
latter in particular they appeared to be extremely anxious. They also
made several other requests; on which I promised that the Netherlands'
government should watch over their interests, but that their prosperity
must depend chiefly on their own exertions.

From the account of the natives themselves, the sea coast population of
the island is far from being numerous, many of the inhabitants having
retired to the other islands after the destruction of Sau. On the other
hand, the mountaineers, who are called Arafuras, are in great numbers,
these simple people considering themselves as the subjects of the
inhabitants of the coast. The natives of the north and east coasts of
Wetta have a bad character, having plundered and murdered the crews of
two prahus a short time previous to my visit to the island.

The Arafuras of the interior had been in a very unsettled state some
time past, all regularity of government having been put an end to by
the death of the Raja, Johannes Pitta, whose heir had retired with his
mother to the island of Kissa. The natives besought me in the most
earnest manner to summon this young man back to his native island, and
install him as their chief.

The two chiefs and several of the people, returned with me to the brig,
where I presented them with some cloth and a Dutch flag, promising to
promote their interests to the best of my power at Kissa, towards which
island, having nothing more to detain me here, I now steered.

Kissa possesses only two anchoring places, one on the west, and the
other on the south-east side of the island. When seen from a distance
the land does not appear to be much elevated above the level of the
sea, but on a nearer approach it will be perceived that the shores rise
abruptly from the water, and are of a very rocky nature. Small creeks
and inlets are to be seen here and there, but these will only admit
prahus of a small draught of water. In former times Kissa was the seat
of the Dutch Residency of the south-west islands,[9] and it is still
the most populous of the group, the people being also farther advanced
in civilization than their neighbours.

In standing westward towards the roads, we ran close along the
south-west side of the island, where the violent breaking of the sea
against the steep shore, presented a very picturesque appearance; but
to us, who were at a very small distance from the land, the sight
was combined with something of the terrific. On the 13th of June we
anchored in a bight to the northward of the south-west point, on a
strip of sand and rocks, with very irregular soundings on it, and
moored the brig with a hawser made fast to the steep shore. The beach
was here flat and sandy, but was fronted by a reef, steep to on the
outer side, over which small prahus can go at the time of high water.
The inhabitants haul up their _jonkos_ (trading prahus of about twenty
tons burthen) on the beach.

The natives hoisted a Dutch flag on our arrival, and several of the
chiefs came off to welcome us to their shores shortly after we had come
to an anchor. I soon went on shore, accompanied by M. Kam and several
of the gentlemen, when we found a multitude of natives assembled on
the beach to receive us, provided with litters to carry us up into the
country. The proofs of joy at our arrival, evinced by the assembled
crowd, were indeed striking in the extreme.

My attention was first directed to the fort Vollenhoven, which was
situated a little to the northward of our anchorage, in the middle
of an extensive level plain. The fort consisted of an inclosure
about ninety feet square, formed by stone walls ten feet high and
three feet in thickness, with a gate on the east side, and a bastion
with four embrasures on the south-west and north-east corners. This
portion of the fort was still in a good and serviceable state, but
the interior works and the building had all fallen to the ground, the
greater portion of the materials having been destroyed by the white
ant.[10] We found five dismounted cannon lying on the sea bastion, one
a one-pounder, and the others four-pounders, which were still in good
condition. The fort, with all its contents, were considered by the
natives as the property of the old East India Company, and for this
reason had been preserved untouched by the natives, who viewed them as
relics. They eagerly offered to put these, together with the Residency
House, which was much decayed, into repair, if a Dutch garrison were
again placed among them.

Marna, the chief village, which lies inland about half an hour's
journey from the fort, is approached by means of a pathway, shaded by
high trees, running along a deep valley. The village has an appearance
of great neatness, the houses, many of which have the sides constructed
of planks, being surrounded by gardens kept in the greatest order; and,
although the buildings are of different heights and sizes, the village
has by no means an irregular appearance. It is enclosed on one side by
a stone wall, and on the other three by live hedges, or _pagga_ fences.
All the inhabitants profess the Christian religion, and the large and
well-built church in which they perform their devotions is kept in a
state of perfect order. The village altogether presents a charming
proof of the order, neatness, and industry of the inhabitants, by which
they have naturally arisen to a greater state of prosperity than will
be found in most other native places. The whole island consists of
clusters of hillocks, luxuriantly clothed with herbage, the summits
of which we often ascended to enjoy the delightful prospect afforded
by the villages and cultivated fields spread over the country, the
scene being enlivened by the presence of men, women and children,
busily pursuing their avocations. Agriculture, however, is not so much
attended to as could be wished, as the natives are obliged to import
rice and maize from Wetta, but cattle and stock are in the greatest
abundance.

The people of Kissa devote themselves chiefly to commercial pursuits,
carrying on a brisk trade with the neighbouring islands; and in
this point of view Kissa must be considered as the most important
in the group. Their commercial propensities, however, have been
disadvantageous to them as far as the improvement of agriculture is
concerned.

It had been arranged that a general meeting of the inhabitants
should take place on the 14th of June, to give me an opportunity of
making known to them the purport of my visit. At nine o'clock in the
morning of the day fixed on, I sent forward a detachment of twenty
armed European seamen to the village, under the command of one of
my officers, and soon afterwards I left the brig for the shore,
accompanied by Messrs. Ram and Dielwaart, with the officers of the
brig, the clerk and the interpreters, under a salute from the guns.
The natives received us on the beach with much ceremony, and conveyed
us in litters towards the town, amid the firing of lelahs and the
joyous shouts of the natives; these proofs of friendship being the more
agreeable from their evident sincerity.

To my great satisfaction, I found that nearly every chief of the island
was present at the meeting, and I was heartily welcomed by the upper
Orang Kaya in the name of them all. Immediately after this, the entire
multitude cried out simultaneously, "_Tarima kasipada tūhan Alla,
Compania būlūm lūpa sama kami orang_," ("Thanks be to God, the Company
have not yet forgotten us.")

The letter sent to them by the Governor of the Moluccas was now read
in a loud voice by the interpreter, under a salvo from the small
arms, according to the custom of the natives; and soon afterwards I
distributed among them the presents with which I had been furnished for
them by the Government. I have frequently observed, that the natives
never decide on any point at the moment, but consult with each other
until they have come to a determination. I therefore left them for a
time, that they might have their deliberations to themselves. On my
return, as I had expected, they expressed themselves very thankful for
the good wishes of the Government, and earnestly requested that a small
detachment of troops might be established among them as formerly, and
that the Government would send them also a missionary or teacher to
instruct them in the tenets of Christianity, for whose maintenance they
would amply provide. I now, in the name of the Government, confirmed
the authority of the various chiefs, in token of which I delivered
the staves of office[11] formerly presented to their chiefs by the old
East India Company, into the hands of their successors. The chief Orang
Kaya, Zacharis Frederick Bakker, had in his possession a certificate
of chieftainship furnished him by the present Government, which he
requested me to inspect. I then presented him with one of the silver
knobbed staves I had brought with me, promising that the Government
would afterwards replace it with one provided with a golden knob.

At this meeting, the fugitives from Wetta, (among whom was the heir
of the above-mentioned Orang Kaya, Pitta) were present. The chiefs of
Kissa promised henceforward to interest themselves in the affairs of
Wetta, in doing which they would be promoting their own welfare. I also
suggested to them how advantageous it would prove were they to bring
their productions to Banda and Amboyna, and gave them much advice as
to the best means by which they might increase their prosperity. After
this the assembly was broken up, amid a continued firing of lelahs in
all parts of the village.

In the meantime a long table had been laid out in the European fashion,
with plates, knives, forks and spoons, on which were placed pastry,
and other refreshments for our entertainment. The natives of these
parts are generally very partial to our national customs, and are also
desirous of following the Dutch fashions in their mode of dress. I took
my place at the table with the chiefs, while the seamen, who were not
forgotten, partook of a separate repast. I had brought on shore several
bottles of wine and liqueurs, which added greatly to the conviviality
of the meeting, many toasts applicable to the occasion being given.
Many of the natives, especially the more respectable, spoke a few words
of Dutch, and they took care to make their knowledge apparent at every
opportunity.

M. Kam having expressed a wish to perform divine service at the
church after the conclusion of the meeting, we entered this neat and
substantial building, where we found that every auditor was provided
with a proper seat, although, owing to our presence, the church was
very full. M. Kam gave a discourse in Malayan and Dutch. The unbroken
silence maintained by the auditors, their deep attention, and the truly
religious gravity which sat upon every countenance, rendered the scene
highly solemn and impressive. When the service was over, about sixty
of the natives, old as well as young, were christened by M. Kam, who
also united twelve couples in marriage.

The village church is ninety feet in length and forty in breadth, the
roof being elevated about, sixty feet from the ground. The costume
of the natives was rather singular. They had naturally clothed
themselves in their best on this important occasion, some wearing
old fashioned-coats with wide sleeves, and broad skirts; others
garments of the same description, but of a more modern cut, while
the remainder were clad in long black _kabyas_, or loose coats, the
usual dress of native Christians. The costume of those who were clad
in the old fashioned coats, was completed by short breeches, shoes
with enormous buckles, and three-cornered or round felt hats, of an
ancient description. Many of the women wore old Dutch chintz gowns or
jackets, the costume of the remainder being the native _sarong_ and
_kabya_. The heads of the women were adorned with ornaments of gold and
precious stones, but the men wore their long hair simply confined with
a tortoise-shell comb, after the mode adopted by the native Christians
of Amboyna. These quaint costumes acted as a considerable foil to
the sedateness of the meeting; but even the unpolished seamen did not
commit themselves by giving vent to their mirth, and the whole service
was performed amid the most perfect order and regularity.

After leaving the church we were invited with much kindness into many
of the private houses, and always found small tables laid out with
refreshments, the hosts endeavouring, to the best of their power, to
receive us with hospitality.

The people of Kissa are far in advance of those of Amboyna in point
of industry. Every house that we visited was surrounded by a garden,
laid out with much care, in which were planted Indian corn, tobacco,
cabbages, _siri_ (_piper betel_), and various sorts of culinary
vegetables, while large herds of cattle were grazing in the valleys.

It was late in the afternoon when we made preparations to return on
board. We left the village attended by a multitude of the people, the
seamen walking in advance, with drums beating and colours flying,
while the officers and myself were carried in litters as before, the
kind-hearted and thankful islanders greeting us with blessings and
shouts of joy, accompanied by the firing of their lelahs.

On my return on board, I judged it inadvisable to remain under the
coast during the night, as we were anchored with a cable of _gumuti_,
(the hairy bark of the _borassus gumutus_), which is more liable to
chafe over the rocks than those of European hemp. Indeed, towards
evening the cable parted, which obliged us to stand off and on during
the night. Ships navigating these seas should always be provided with
chain cables. While the eastern monsoon prevails, the current sets to
the eastward, or to windward through these islands, from Dilli, or
Timor, as far as the island of Baba. This remark will be of value to
navigators, as by taking advantage of this weather current they may
work to windward through these islands with facility.

On the morning of the 15th I again went on shore, and, after visiting
the village, penetrated farther into the interior than I had previously
been. Proofs of the industry and orderly habits of the natives were
encountered at every step. My attention was particularly drawn to the
course of instruction adopted at the schools, where all the children,
under nine or ten years of age, assembled to learn reading and writing,
and the rudiments of Christianity.

I observed a strong partiality for a military life among the young men,
and there can be no doubt that, if well disciplined, they would prove
excellent auxiliary troops for the Government.

Having confirmed the appointment of several chiefs, and fulfilled my
duties in every particular, I took a friendly leave of the Orang Kayas
and the people, who brought on board a quantity of provisions and
fruit as presents, and firing some guns as a last farewell to these
good-hearted islanders, we shaped our course for the adjacent island of
Lette.

CHAPTER IV.

LETTE.

Arrival at the Island of Lette.--Anchoring Place.--Series
of Disasters.--Character of the Inhabitants.--The
Mountaineers.--Differences among the Islanders.--Good Effects of our
Mediation.--Respect entertained by the Natives towards the Dutch
Government.

On the following morning, June 17th, we found ourselves close under
the south-west point of Lette, and perceived reefs extending along the
shore at a distance of half a mile from the land. This island is, for
the most part, high and hilly, but near the sea the land is level. The
greater portion of the inhabitants reside on the sea-coast, in villages
erected upon elevated and projecting points of land, which present a
charming appearance as the island is approached. We ran close along
the reefs until opposite to the village of Tombra, where there is an
opening in the reef, into which we warped the brig, and moored her
head and stern. The inlet or basin, which afforded us anchorage, is
from four hundred to five hundred feet broad, with depths of six to
nine fathoms over a sandy bottom. It is bounded on each side by reefs
visible at low water, and at the extremity of the cove lies a white
sandy beach covered with numerous cocoa-nut trees.

As soon as the brig was secured, I landed with the native interpreter,
at a spot where several of the Christian inhabitants were waiting
to conduct us to the village. This did not present an appearance
indicating prosperity, as it contained no more than twenty-five houses,
occupied both by Christians and heathens. During the previous year,
three villages in the neighbourhood had been entirely destroyed by
fire, the inhabitants losing all their household property; and shortly
afterwards an additional disaster occurred in the death of the Orang
Kaya, to whom no successor had yet been appointed. The anarchy and
confusion this gave rise to, had caused many of the people to abandon
the spot. Those who received us on the beach evinced great joy at our
arrival, and expressed hopes that through my intervention, order would
again be restored.

It was very soon known throughout the island that a Dutch ship of war
had arrived, and the people flocked from all parts of the country to
bid us welcome. Among these was an Amboynese teacher, who had arrived
here about two years previously. He expressed a wish that I would visit
the school-room, which also served the purpose of a church since the
building had been destroyed by the fire already mentioned. To this I
willingly consented. The scholars, a number of boys and girls, were
arranged in a row, and, as I approached, they commenced singing a
hymn. After it was concluded, I inspected the school-house, a wretched
building, the whole furniture of which consisted of a long table and
some bamboo benches. The teacher resided in an adjacent hut, around
which a small garden had been laid out. Every thing that met our view
presented an appearance of poverty and decay.

Two years previous to our visit, this group of islands had been visited
by a violent hurricane, which, especially on Lette, caused frightful
devastation: on several tracts of land over which I passed, all the
cocoa-nut and other fruit-trees had been levelled with the earth.
This disaster had been followed by a drought, which had destroyed the
produce of their plantations, and created a great mortality among the
cattle, many dying for want of provender. The hurricane had also caused
the bees to desert the island, a serious loss to the inhabitants,
since wax and honey were among the chief exportable productions of the
island. These repeated misfortunes had induced many of the inhabitants
to emigrate to Kissa and Roma; in fact, the scarcity of provisions had
been so great, that some had actually died from want. This unlucky
island, like ancient Egypt, had indeed been harassed and afflicted by
a series of plagues. It presented a sad spectacle, especially when
compared with the prosperous island of Kissa, the beauties of which
were still fresh in our remembrance.

The Christian inhabitants of Lette bear great resemblance in manners,
customs, and mode of dress, to those of Kissa. The unconverted natives,
who consider themselves as subjects to the former, are still low in
the scale of civilization, but are worthy of remark as unsophisticated
children of nature. They are tall and well formed, with light brown
complexions. Their noses are pointed, and their foreheads high,
while their hair, naturally black, is rendered yellow, by rubbing
in a composition of lime. It is confined by means of a bamboo comb.
The men wear no other dress than a piece of cloth made from the bark
of a tree, wrapped round the waist. The women, in addition to this
article of clothing, sometimes wear a sort of _kabya_, or short
gown, open in front. Polygamy does not obtain among them, and the men
appear generally to be much attached to their wives. Adultery very
seldom occurs; indeed, the natives have such an abhorrence of this
and every other misdemeanour, that a person found guilty is punished
with death, or is sold to foreigners, and thus doomed to perpetual
slavery. I was informed that all their goods and chattels are kept
in their huts, which are unprovided with doors, or in caves on the
mountains; but that notwithstanding these temptations, instances of
theft very rarely occur, this crime, like that of incontinence, being
considered as conferring an indelible stain on the whole family of
the culprit, who either kill him with their own hands, or sell him
into slavery. The East India Company, during their occupation of these
islands, introduced a philanthropic law, which required them to give
up all their criminals, that they might be sent to cultivate the spice
plantations of Banda.

These people are idolatrous in every sense of the word, since they pay
reverence to an image of human shape, rudely carved from a thick piece
of wood. This image is placed in a sitting posture upon a square heap
of stone, raised under a large tree in the centre of the village. In
the event of a death, a marriage, or any remarkable event, a large hog
or a buffalo, which has been kept sacred and fattened for the purpose,
is slaughtered before this image. Cattle and other stock form the chief
wealth of the natives; but they also possess elephants' tusks, brass
wire, gongs, plates and dishes of coarse Chinese porcelain, chopping
knives, &c., together with golden ornaments, such as chains, half-moons
and ear-rings, these being denominated _harta_, or household property.

On one occasion I was present at the funeral of a native, which took
place in the village of Batu Meau. The body had been laid in the grave
previous to my arrival. A number of men were assembled round the
spot, who were soon joined by a large party of women, bearing baskets
containing household goods and dressed provisions, which were thrown
into the grave by each as she approached. A number of aged women now
commenced a loud wailing, which they continued without intermission
until the grave was filled up with earth. The crowd then collected
around the idol, to which a quantity of provisions were offered, and
the remainder of the day was spent by the people in feasting and
praying around it.

The chiefs of the various villages, who came on board to bid me
welcome to their shores, were conveyed in lightly constructed prahus,
similar in appearance to the _orang-baays_[12] used by the Amboynese.
Each of these contained thirty rowers, who propelled the vessel with
broad paddles; these being far more serviceable than oars, for the
use of which there would scarcely be sufficient space. The chiefs
rowed in state round the brig three times, beating small gongs called
_tif-tifs_, the music being accompanied by a loud singing, the burthen
of which was "_Salamat Compania_." They then came alongside, and
informed me that these vessels and their crews were "_Prahu Compania_,"
(government prahus), and that they were perfectly at my service. During
the period in which the East India Company had establishments on these
islands, the people of each village were obliged to have one of these
prahus at all times in readiness for the use of the Resident, or head
officer of the Government. The people of the islands have also been
accustomed to other requisitions on the part of our Government, to
which they comply with the greatest alacrity, feeling hurt whenever
their assistance is not accepted. I found the prahus they offered to me
on this occasion, of considerable service in bringing off wood, water,
and other necessaries.

The day following that of my arrival was fixed on for a general meeting
of the chiefs, at which I intended to present them with the letters
sent them by the Government, and to transact the remainder of the
public business which had brought me here. About seven o'clock in the
evening a singular spectacle presented itself. A number of women,
taking advantage of the lowness of the tide, collected on the beach to
catch fish and crabs, each bearing a flambeau composed of bamboo and
resin, and as more than three hundred of these were burning at the same
time, they formed a splendid illumination.

On the morning of the 18th, a small brig, belonging to Mr. Franquemont,
a merchant of Sourabaya, arrived in the basin. The object of the
captain in visiting the island was to purchase stock, which the Java
traders are in the habit of obtaining here, but as at the present time
the natives had none for sale, the brig sailed immediately for one of
the neighbouring islands.

At nine o'clock in the morning of the day fixed for the meeting,
I landed, accompanied by several of the gentlemen attached to the
expedition, and by a detachment of marines, (as I shall henceforward
call the armed seamen,) the brig firing a salute from her great guns.
Several of the chiefs and a large number of the people had already
assembled, to whom the interpreter read the letter sent by our
Government, with the usual accompaniment of a _feu-de-joie_ from the
musketry. The business connected with the subject of the letter was
soon transacted, but the arrangement of other affairs was attended
with much more difficulty than had been experienced at Kissa, the
natives there being farther advanced in civilization than at Lette.
I was employed during two entire days in deciding petty differences
that had arisen among them. A spirit of contention upon the merest
trifles forms a peculiar trait in the character of these islanders,
and they appeared to prefer living in variance, indeed, in a state of
open warfare with one another, to making the least advances towards
reconciliation. They would sacrifice all they possessed to keep up the
strife, and the result of these disturbances was that many families
were forced to wander in poverty over the island, while some actually
died of want. The people frankly acknowledged their failing upon
this point, to obviate which they were anxious that a Dutch Resident
or other government officer should reside among them, to whom they
might refer their disputes for adjustment. They promised to abide
implicitly by his decision; indeed, during my short stay on the island
I had numerous proofs of their willingness to admit our mediation,
of which I will here give an example. Throughout the Molucca Seas it
had been the custom of the Government to permit those chiefs, whose
conduct had been highly meritorious, to carry a Dutch pennant in their
_orang-baays_, or state barges. This mark of distinction had been
conferred upon some former chiefs of the village of Batu Meau, and
their successors, considering themselves as being also entitled to it,
continued to display the pennant from their prahus. This assumption
on their part had drawn upon them the violent enmity of the chiefs
of the neighbouring villages, who had ever since been in a state of
open warfare with those of Batu Meau. It will readily be conceived how
difficult it was to reconcile parties so strongly embittered against
each other. It required some time to convince the chiefs of Batu Meau,
that they had acted wrongly; but at length I was fortunate enough
to bring the affair to a favourable termination, the chiefs being
prohibited from ever again displaying the offensive banner.

In my notices of Wetta, I mentioned that the village of Sau, on that
island, had been destroyed by the people of Lette. From the information
concerning the affair that I was enabled to collect here, it appeared
that nine natives of Lette, who had visited the village of Sau on a
trading voyage, had been massacred by the inhabitants, who had been
tempted to commit the deed by a desire to gain possession of the
goods that the traders had brought with them. According to the law
of retaliation which obtains among the natives of the Archipelago,
this deed demanded vengeance on the part of the people of Lette, who
proceeded to Wetta with a number of armed prahus, and totally destroyed
the village of Sau. This affair had naturally given rise to the direct
enmity between the natives of the two islands, which entirely put
a stop to the commercial intercourse that had previously subsisted
between them, and but for our own interposition, a reconciliation could
never have been effected. This case affords a striking example of the
detriment these islanders suffer from the barbarous nature of their
laws, or rather customs.

When distributing the presents, sent by the Government, at the general
meeting of the chiefs, I was requested to apportion the shares for each
village, the chiefs themselves candidly confessing that since they all
considered themselves as equal in point of rank, were this duty left to
themselves, it would certainly give rise to a renewal of the discord
that had so long prevailed among them. Although their old _adats_ or
customs, are so absurd and contradictory, that their interests are
greatly injured by maintaining them, they yet, with an obstinacy for
which it is difficult to account, submit to and revere them as sacred
and inviolable laws.

On the east side of Lette, near the village of Batu Meau, we met with a
block-house, surrounded by a high stone wall, which had formerly been
occupied by a garrison of the Dutch East India Company. It was in a
state of great dilapidation, indeed, every thing we encountered bore
evident marks of the poverty and misery of the people, which, however,
is in a great measure to be attributed to the unavoidable disasters
which had befallen them. I promised the chiefs that I would inform
the Government of their difficulties, and stated to them that I had
remained at the island longer than I had originally intended, with the
hope that my mediation would effect a termination to their disputes.
I urged them strongly to live henceforward in unity, and I had the
satisfaction of perceiving, before my departure from the island, a
considerable improvement in their social state, the people of the
different villages having become on far better terms with one another.
The exhortations and advice of that estimable clergyman, M. Kam, had
also effected much good. Many of the people were baptized and married
by him, the solemnity with which these duties were performed making
a deep impression on the susceptible minds of this simple, and by no
means badly-disposed people. Before our departure they gave proofs of a
returning spirit of industry, by commencing to repair their church and
houses.

From Lette I proceeded to Moa, of which island I will give a
description in the ensuing chapter.

MOA AND ROMA.

Boat Expedition to the Island of Moa.--Good Inclination of the
Inhabitants.--The Block-house.--The Duif Family.--Character of the
People.--Respect entertained by the Heathen towards the Christian
Inhabitants.--State of Civilization and Public Instruction.--Kind
Hospitality of the Natives.--Their Feelings of Attachment and
Confidence towards the Dutch Government.--Departure for the Island of
Roma.

According to an old _adat_ or custom, the ships of the Dutch East India
Company never anchored off Moa, but remained at Lette, whence the
Company's servants were conducted to Moa by a chief of that island, who
came over for the purpose; and as I did not wish to make an inroad into
old usages, I made known my arrival to the people of Moa, upon which
the chief of the village of Tombra came over to welcome me, and to
offer his vessel for my accommodation during the proposed expedition.
On the 21st of June I departed for Moa, accompanied by several of my
officers, and followed by two of our boats carrying the detachment of
marines, while a number of native prahus brought up the rear. Having
a fair wind, we soon arrived off the west coast of the island, where
we found a large crowd of the natives assembled, who gave us a most
enthusiastic welcome. I cannot find terms to describe how gratifying it
was to us to discover in all these islands, so sincere and unanimous
a feeling of attachment towards our Government; for the long period,
during which the friendly communication between these inhabitants and
the Dutch had been discontinued, appeared only to have added fresh fuel
to their attachment.

The part of the island at which we had arrived was due east from the
village of Batu Mean, and no sooner had we stepped on shore than
a number of litters, which had been prepared for us, were brought
forward, when there existed no little commotion among the crowd, each
wishing that the village to which he belonged should be honoured by our
first visit. Here we took a kind farewell of the chiefs of Lette who
had accompanied us, when they departed homewards amid repeated mutual
congratulations. We now deposited ourselves in the litters, which were
provided with curtains of chintz or coloured cotton; our own party,
which numbered six, together with the chiefs, being carried in this
manner, and as the crowd was very great, the bearers could change
frequently during our tolerably long journey to the head village.
Behind us walked the detachment of marines, and the domestics who
carried the presents, so that our train had a very imposing appearance.

Our way lay, for the most part, over level uninhabited land, cultivated
in some places, and in others overgrown with _allang-allang_, a
sort of wild grass, growing to the height of four or five feet. The
foot-path was narrow and bad, and this, combined with the heat of the
sun, and the length of the distance, rendered the journey extremely
painful, especially to our marines. We had left the landing-place at
half-past eight, and owing to these difficulties did not arrive at our
destination until one in the afternoon, and as this was too long a
period to remain in the litters, we often relieved our cramped limbs by
walking.

The villages of Roksali, Taynama, and Patti, to which we were
journeying, are situated on a piece of high coral ground near the
beach, and are separated from each other by high stone walls. We
marched into the chief of these with drums beating and colours
flying, and were received by the inhabitants with much friendship and
confidence. One of the chiefs requested us to stay a short time under
the shade of a high tree in the village, when he left us, and soon
afterwards we were welcomed with much ceremony by a very aged native,
who was entirely clad in an ancient European costume. He wore a large
wig, a three-cornered hat, short breeches with large knee-buckles,
and a coat with wide sleeves, ruffles, and spacious skirts; while on
his feet he had high shoes, with heavy silver buckles: in short, he
was clad after the fashion of the seventeenth century. This old man
frankly offered us whatever the village contained, stating that men
and goods were at our disposal; and declaring that our arrival had
inspired him and his countrymen with the greatest delight. His joy was
not feigned, for in many conversations which I afterwards held with
him he gave most unequivocal proofs of his earnest attachment to the
Dutch Government, and the sincerity of his feelings was undoubted,
as, although he reasoned well, he yet gave proofs of great age having
impaired his understanding; therefore he would have been unable to keep
his duplicity concealed had any existed. This old man had once been
governor or regent of the island. The whole population viewed him with
the highest respect; they consulted him on every affair of importance,
and his clear knowledge of men and things, coupled with his long
experience, gave him a great influence over them. He had resigned his
authority several years since, and his grandson, of whom mention will
be made hereafter, had been appointed his successor, with the title of
Upper Orang Kaya.

After I had remained under the high tree some time conversing with
this worthy native, we were conducted to a Block-house, situated near
the sea, which had formerly been the abode of the garrison left here
by the (Dutch) East India Company. This building, which was tolerably
large, and of great strength, was surrounded by a good stone wall, one
hundred and fifty paces square, provided with several look-out houses,
and four doors. Upon a board above the door of the house were cut these
words:--"_De Korporaal Duif heeft dit gebouw gesticht in het jaar
17_..,"[13] the date was legible no farther.

The natives had preserved the Block-house in a good state of repair,
out of regard for the Company (which term they usually apply to the
Netherlands' Government,) and in the hope that they would once more
be favoured (this was their expression) by the presence of a Dutch
garrison. Even the bed places of the three soldiers, who had resided
here, were left entire. On the occasion of our coming the entire
building had been repaired and beautified, so that at the present time
it was in a very serviceable state.

I will here give an instance of the nice sense of propriety shown by
these people, at which I must confess I was surprised. No sooner had
we expressed a wish to take a little rest than they all retired, no
one coming near unless called for; while two natives posted themselves
at the door, to inform those who wished to enter that we were not to
be disturbed; and this was done without any wish to that effect having
been expressed by any one of our party.

A family who went by the name of Duif, were among those who came to
greet me on my arrival. The head of the family announced to me that
he was the son of the Corporal Duif who had been entrusted with the
erection of the Block-house, and that his father had married a native
woman, from whom had sprung a very numerous progeny. I found here, as
well as on the islands I had previously visited, that it is a mark of
distinction to have sprung from an European. Those who have a mixture
of our blood in their veins, are called "Anak Compania" (children of
the Company), and they are not a little proud of the title, although it
confers upon them no exclusive privileges.

Immediately after we had entered the Block-house, and our baggage had
been brought in, the bearers and other natives retired, a chief and six
others remaining, to attend to our wants. Meat, eggs, milk and Indian
corn were brought to us, and with this they prepared a patriarchal
meal, which was seasoned with kind hospitality.

The place where we had taken up our residence was situated on the
south-west point of the island, close to the shore, where the reefs are
steep to, so that here, especially in the rainy monsoon, there is a
very heavy surf. On every point of the east side of the island there is
good and convenient anchorage.

The inhabitants of Moa turn their chief attention to breeding cattle,
and grow only a small quantity of vegetables and Indian corn, the two
last being chiefly for home consumption. The vessels which come to
trade with the island generally anchor under the coast of Lette, and
obtain the buffaloes, goats, hogs, and fowls from natives of Lette,
who go to Moa to purchase them; but the traders themselves sometimes go
to Moa to fetch them in their own prahus. The inhabitants of the latter
island never carry their stock to sea in their own vessels, as, from an
old tradition, they entertain a superstitious notion that, were they
to do so, some serious misfortune would inevitably befal them. Their
flocks and herds are composed chiefly of sheep and buffaloes.

On Moa, as well as on most of the other islands, the population is
divided into two classes, Christians and heathens, which may be
considered as standing in the same relation to each other as masters
and subjects. The subordination of the heathens, (who are by far the
most numerous,) and the respect they entertain towards the Christians,
are very remarkable, and may be partly attributed to the superior
consideration in which the Christians are held by our Government; but
undeniably, it is in a great measure owing to an irresistible belief on
the part of the heathens, in the moral superiority of the Christians.
That the latter must be the chief cause is apparent, from no Dutch ship
of war having visited these islands for a long series of years.

On the north-east point of Moa, a solitary high mountain, called
_Korbou_, or Buffalo Peak, resembling in appearance, but much inferior
in height to the famed Peak of Teneriffe, raises its head above the
remaining part of the island, which consists generally of flat land.
The ground is everywhere corally; and on the south and south-eastern
parts of the island there is very little cultivation. The extensive
plains, which produce nothing but _allang-allang_, are converted into
good meadow land by the skill of the natives, who, at the end of the
dry season, when this coarse grass has been almost withered by the
continued heat and drought, set fire to it, and it is soon reduced to
ashes. The rains, which shortly follow, combined with the heat of the
sun, render the land thus prepared very productive, the ashes forming
an excellent manure. The young grass, which now springs up, affords
sumptuous fare for the stock; this fact being attested by the sleek and
fat condition of the buffaloes, sheep, and other animals which feed
upon it; indeed, the buffaloes of Moa are considered to be the best
that can be procured among those islands.

Specie is seldom or never in use among the natives, cloth, brass-wire
and other articles of foreign manufacture or produce, being used as a
medium of exchange. A buffalo is to be purchased by goods to the value
of five or six guilders (8*s.* 4*d.* to 10*s.*), while the price of a
sheep is from two to three guilders. Fishing is not so much pursued,
either by the people of Moa, or by those of the neighbouring islands,
as one would be led to expect, when the abundance of fish is taken into
consideration. No wild animals are to be met with on the island. A few
blue pigeons are occasionally seen; but I have traversed the island
for hours together, in company with some other lovers of field-sports,
without meeting with any game.

On the day after our arrival at the head village, I commenced
transacting the business with which I had been entrusted. The
assembling of the chiefs and people was conducted in the same manner
as in Kissa and Lette, and I was constantly employed for three days
attending to their affairs, instituting measures for increasing their
prosperity, and forming plans for bettering their social state,
especially as far as regards public instruction. The natives expressed
their desire, as strongly as those I had previously visited, to receive
among them a Dutch garrison, and a local teacher for their youth. I
noted down the chief points of their desires, and promised that I would
make them known to the Governor of the Moluccas.

It is generally supposed by us that the inhabitants of those distant
places are only Christians in name, and have very little true knowledge
of our religion; but I am authorized to say from experience, that this
opinion is far from being a just one. To my surprise I found among the
Christians of Moa, not only an extensive knowledge of the Bible, but
also a very clear notion of our religious doctrines. There are very
many among them who read and write very well, and when it is taken
into consideration that very little instruction has been given them
for a long series of years, we cannot help forming a good opinion of
the industry and docility of this simple people; I can bear witness
that, on this point, the inhabitants of this little island are equal,
if not superior, to the natives of Amboyna, who have had far better
opportunities of instruction afforded them.

The presence of M. Kam was in the highest degree agreeable to the
inhabitants, and they listened with a profound attention, and a lively
interest, to the religious discourses of this zealous clergyman, who
baptized and married many of his hearers, my fellow voyagers and
myself deriving much pleasure from being present at the ceremonies.
The religious state of these people is, in a great measure, to be
attributed to the exertions of M. Le Bruin, a zealous missionary of
Coepang on Timor, who occasionally visits some of these islands.

On the 23rd I appointed the chiefs to the various villages, together
with an upper Orang-Kaya, to whom I gave a baton with a silver knob,
and a Dutch flag. During our stay on the island our table was supplied
in the greatest abundance with meat, vegetables, fruit, and every
thing that the island afforded; and when I offered anything to the
bearers as payment for these, it was civilly but firmly refused, with
the declaration that they had received orders to take nothing either
as payment or as reward. All that I could induce them to receive as
a token of acknowledgment was a small cask of arrack, of which they
appear to be great admirers, although they make a very moderate use of
it, and deem it a great disgrace to be found guilty of drinking it to
excess.

When I mentioned to the chiefs that I had myself taken on board the
provisions I deemed necessary, and that, should I require any more, I
would willingly demand and pay for it, that I might be no burthen to
the people, my proposal appeared to be by no means agreeable to them.
They answered, it was an old custom for the natives to administer
to the wants of the Company, and that the people would regret seeing
a change in the system, _as this custom afforded them a wished-for
opportunity of giving a slight proof of their attachment, and they
would feel hurt at being deprived of this gratification_.

In the mean time, I remarked that they were making preparations to
give something more than this "slight proof of attachment," in the
shape of a national feast to celebrate the occasion of our visit, and
the renewal of their former friendship with the Dutch. As this feast,
however, would have detained me two days more, while my time was too
valuable to be thrown away, I was forced to decline their invitation,
informing them that my departure was irrevocably fixed for the 24th of
June. In the course of this day they showed us all possible friendship,
as if they wished to make themselves doubly useful during the short
period in which we should remain. The evening was spent in making
farewell visits, and at half-past four in the morning our bearers were
in readiness, when the chiefs conducted us to the boats, the upper
Orang-kaya accompanying us to the brig, where we arrived at two o'clock
in the afternoon. The people of Moa, as a parting present, sent after
us two fat bullocks, as if what they had already done for us were not
enough.

Having thus, according to my instructions, done my utmost towards
deciding their differences, and placing their affairs on a firm basis,
I took my departure on the 27th of June for Roma, a hilly island, about
twenty-four miles in circumference, lying about forty miles to the
north-west of Moa. On the same day we arrived off Roma, and anchored in
seven fathoms on a bank of sand, extending northward to the distance of
about half a mile from Nusa Midta, a small island lying off the south
end of Roma, from which it is separated by a strait about three miles
wide. There is also a bay on the north-west side of Roma, in which
it is said that there is very good anchorage, but that part of the
island possesses a very scanty population, while the uncleared state
of the country renders it difficult to perform a journey to the chief
villages, all of which are situated on the more southern parts of the
island. On the south-west side of Roma, immediately opposite to the
north end of Nusa-Midta, lies a fine and fertile valley, through which
runs a small river. In the west monsoon there is good anchorage for
a vessel opposite the mouth of this river, from which abundance of
timber and fire-wood, and good water, may be obtained. On all the other
sides of the island the shores are steep and rocky, on which beats a
heavy surf, rendering the landing from boats extremely difficult.

The population of Roma is not very great. The inhabitants, however,
are more civilized than on many of the neighbouring islands, and in
point of industry and morality they vie with the social and orderly
people of Kissa. The chief village was situated to the north-north-east
of our anchoring place, on a hill about four hundred feet above the
level of the sea, the houses, with the hills rising behind it like an
amphitheatre, presenting a very beautiful landscape. Their village was
formerly built upon the beach, but the repeated attacks of the Ceramese
pirates forced them to remove it to its present site.

The Orang Kayas and Orang Tuas, as usual, came on board to welcome
us; and on the following morning I went on shore, accompanied by M.
Dielwart, M. Kam, the surgeon, the clerk, the interpreters, and the
detachment of marines. As it was high water we had to land through
a very heavy surf, when we were received with much friendship, and
introduced into the _Kota Compania_, (the Government block-house,)
which consisted of a spacious bamboo house, surrounded by a stone
wall, within which there was also a tolerably large church. In
consequence of the removal of the village, these now lie below the
houses of the natives. The level ground in the neighbourhood is covered
with dwellings, each being surrounded by a neat garden. Evidence of the
uncommon industry of the people was everywhere apparent, the natural
fertility of the soil being greatly increased by the skill with which
they cultivate it; indeed, many of the neighbouring islands obtain here
their supplies of Indian corn, fruits and other provisions, as well
as timber for building their prahus. A large and beautiful valley,
extending between the hills to the westward of the village of Jerusa,
was covered with plantations of Indian corn, rice and vegetables, while
the sides and summits of the hills were decked with grazing flocks of
goats, sheep, hogs and buffaloes.

During a walk which we took along the shore and thence into the
interior, we spied a number of bees' nests hanging from the branches
of the high trees, some of which more than two feet in circumference.
The wax and honey are collected with very little difficulty, and the
bees, when driven from their nests, generally build another on the same
tree. Wax, indeed, forms a very important article of commerce here,
large quantities of it being sold to the _paduakans_ and other prahus
which come from the Arru Islands, Amboyna and Banda, to obtain it. The
usual price is one third of a guilder per _Catti_ (20 oz. avoird.) and
this is paid in goods, for specie is very little used.

The Christian inhabitants form the greater portion of the population,
and they live on a better footing with the heathens than on the other
islands. The latter, indeed, are very desirous to embrace Christianity,
and a great number of them were baptized by M. Kam during our stay.
They willingly allow their children to learn reading and writing, and
the good disposition of these islanders, coupled with their natural
capacity and application, would render it a matter of facility to
convert the entire population; an event very much to be desired, not
only for the improvement it would effect in their social state, but for
matters of policy also, as experience has incontestibly proved that
those natives who have embraced Christianity shew much more fidelity
towards the Dutch Government than the others. The teacher who has
lately been placed upon this island by our government, and whom we met
during our stay, shews much praise-worthy zeal in his endeavours to
improve the condition of the people with whom he is domiciled.

The government of the entire island is invested in an upper _Orang
Kaya_, who resides at Jerusa, the neighbouring villages having each
their _Orang Tua_ or elder. The power of the Orang Kaya, however, is
by no means absolute, for in the event of any dispute the chiefs of
the villages assemble, and the decision is carried by the majority of
votes. It is remarkable that sometimes, on the death of a chief, his
power is transferred to his wife, so that several women are often to
be seen among the chiefs when assembled in conclave. The debates are
occasionally continued for two or three days, but they are usually
settled without much difference of opinion.

As the people live in such a state of harmony with each other, my
official duties were not very heavy, and were soon brought to a close.
David Benedictus De Klerk, a young man, was appointed as their Upper
Orang Kaya, and solemnly invested with the silver-knobbed cane, to
the general satisfaction of the people. Here also they declared that
everything the country afforded was at our free disposal, and earnestly
requested that a couple of Dutch soldiers might be left behind, as
representatives of our government, with the promise that they should
be liberally supplied with all necessaries. The new appointed Orang
Kaya, and more than one hundred and fifty men, women and children,
were baptized by M. Kam, many of the people present being clad after
the European style, apparently wishing by these means to shew their
attachment to our nation, as was the case at the island of Kissa.

I could not avoid observing that the women of Roma though tall and well
made, and not inferior in point of personal attractions to those of the
adjacent islands, yet have a defect in their figures where their fair
neighbours are particularly favoured by nature. Nearly all the women
we saw here, even those who were nursing children, had bosoms as flat
as those of the men, while in every other respect their figures are
unexceptionable. This striking peculiarity, is perhaps to be attributed
to some local cause, like the _goitre_ in the mountains of Switzerland.

Our departure was fixed for the 30th of June, and on the previous
evening a farewell repast was given at the Kota Compania, at which all
the chiefs were present. I had contributed some bottles of wine, and a
small cask of arrack to the entertainment, and these were expended in
drinking prosperity to the Dutch nation and government. We returned on
board betimes, escorted by a number of native prahus. Although we had
been amply provided with stock and vegetables during our stay, several
goats and hogs were sent after us, which we found it impossible to
refuse.

We steered to the westward along Nusa Midta, which is a small
uninhabited island covered with trees, but not affording any fresh
water. On this and the other islands around Roma abundance of large
turtle are caught by the natives, who do not, however, turn much
attention to fishing, commerce and agriculture being better suited to
their tastes. In the small but important islands which we visited,
the natives might soon be brought into a high state of prosperity,
from which our government would derive the greatest benefit. Even now
they possess capacious vessels, such as Paduakans,[14] Orang-baays and
such like, which they manage with skill, but they have been so long
deprived of the protection of our government that they scarcely dare to
carry on a trade with the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands.

From this place we pursued our voyage towards the island of Damma, of
which some particulars will be given in the ensuing chapter.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 14: Paduakans are native vessels, having a single mast in the
form of a tripod, on which is set a large oblong mat sail, similar to
that used by the fishing prahus of Batavia. They are of from twenty to
one hundred tons burden (_ten tot fifty lasten_) with great beam and
high sides, but having little hold in the water. They are steered by
two long rudders, which are lifted up when the vessel is at anchor or
passing over shallow water.]

Inhabitants.--Warm Springs.--Retrograde Movements of the Natives in

Coast.--The Columba Globicera.--Wild Nutmeg Trees.--General Meeting of

During the voyage I had every reason to be satisfied with the
knowledge, experience, conduct and foresight of my pilot, and therefore
I entered with confidence the Bay of Kulewatte, on the east side of
Damma, although I could not help immediately remarking that it must be
very difficult to sail out of the Bay during the easterly monsoon. The
pilot, however, confidently assured me, that we should have a steady
land wind to carry us out, while there was no other anchoring place
near the island; I therefore brought the brig to an anchor under the
north point of a small cove lying within the great bay, the latter,
which extends about four miles into the land, with high and precipitous
shores, being very rocky, and in many parts unfathomable.[15]

Damma is high and hilly, and on the north-east extremity lies a
volcanic peak, from the crater of which smoke issues almost without
interruption. At the foot of this mountain, near the cove in which
we lay, some warm sulphureous springs gushed up through holes in the
rocks, the water of which was at so high a temperature, that some yams
which I placed in them were cooked within a comparatively short period.
Two of our ship's crew, who were so afflicted with rheumatism as to be
not only unfit for duty, but in a state of great misery, were sent by
our doctor to these springs every morning; and he assured me that the
use of the water contributed greatly to the improvement of their health.

Upon the point of the cove in which we were anchored, we perceived the
remains of a block-house and other buildings, which had been erected
under the direction of the late East India Company, but of which
nothing was now left but some heaps of rubbish; while the neighbouring
country, once fertile and well-cultivated, presented the appearance of
a neglected wilderness, traces of former industry being yet apparent
among the luxuriant vegetation. To the westward of us was a stream
of clear and pure water, from which we filled up our casks. On the
north side of this is placed the village of Selat, once flourishing
and prosperous, but now consisting of only about twenty houses. A
few Christians are still to be met with among the inhabitants, but
by far the greater portion are either heathens, or individuals once
Christians, who have returned to their former habits.

On the north side of the island lies Wilhelmus Bay, which was formerly
the seat of the Dutch Residency, the village on its shore being
considered as the capital of the island. A narrow foot-path, much
broken by the unevenness of the ground, leads through a romantic wild
valley from Selat to this bay.

At first the natives were very shy, fearful and suspicious, and they
received us, as the inhabitants of Atjieh once did an officer of the
Dutch navy, with strung bows and levelled spears, and, like the people
of Atjieh, they placed confidence in us as soon as they learned that
we were Dutch, and officers of the Government. "Orang Wolanda! Orang
Compania!" said they to one another; when they laid by their weapons,
and received us without suspicion. For a period of _thirty_ years
they had not seen a single Dutchman. Their island was seldom visited
by trading vessels, and the Christian population had almost become
extinct. Owing to a want of regular government, and of instruction
for their youth, the people had returned to their original state of
ignorance and barbarism; but nevertheless it could be perceived that
they esteemed highly every relic of the Dutch rule which they had in
their possession.

The islands which we touched at during the previous part of our voyage
are annually visited by Dutch country vessels, and our establishments
remained longer on them than on Damma. Kissa, for example, was occupied
by a civilian and a detachment of soldiers in the early part of the
rule of the present Government; this has certainly been removed a
considerable time, but it is evident that the latter island must have
a great advantage over the others, especially Damma, which, as I have
stated above, had not been visited by a single European for a period
of thirty years. We cannot, therefore, be surprised at the people of
this neglected island having retrograded in point of civilization;
for experience has always proved, that when natives, and especially
native Christians, have been left to themselves, without the advantages
of proper instruction, they have very soon returned to their former
condition. On this point our islanders had been highly unfortunate, as
their uncontrolled desires led to continued differences, and brought
all friendship and unity to an end.

The day after our arrival at Damma I departed on an excursion to
Wilhelmus Bay in the sailing-boat. We found the bay to be entirely
exposed, and with very bad anchoring ground, while in both monsoons
a heavy sea often tumbles in. A small vessel, however, may find more
secure anchorage near the mouth of a small fresh water river.

On the west side of the river we discovered the remains of some strong
masonry, from which it appeared that this must have been the site of
a stronghold. I could gain no correct information from the natives,
(who are wretched chronologists, and can rarely tell their own age),
as to the period in which this was standing, much less as to that in
which it was built. They could only tell me that the Dutch garrison
here had been very numerous, and that it had been removed on a sudden
by the Government, on account of a great mortality which had occurred.
Some aged natives also remembered that at one time Company's ships
often came here. These ruins were, probably, the remains of the fort
Wilhelmsburg or Nassau, which was built here by our old India Company,
in the year 1646, as at that time the island produced a considerable
quantity of spices. The establishment, which consisted of a factor, a
lieutenant, and seventy soldiers, was shortly afterwards withdrawn,
on account of a great mortality which existed, but subsequently a
block-house was erected for the military, as upon the other islands.

The church, houses and block-house had been built with the remains of
the fort, but even this was now in a most dilapidated condition. The
inhabitants themselves were in a state of great poverty, and without
occupation; a considerable number, indeed, had emigrated to other
islands, that they might obtain the necessaries of life by becoming
bondsmen[16] or slaves.

M. Kam, with several of the officers, had come overland, and arrived
here at the same time with ourselves. The whole of the inhabitants,
old and young, ran out to see us, and touch our clothes; and they
shouted with joy at the Company having paid them a visit. Each of us
was soon adopted as a _sobat_, or friend, by one of the natives. On the
first day it was impossible for us to get away from them for a moment;
especially after I had served out to them a _Sopi Compania_, that is, a
glass of arrack. Their joy was sincere and universal.

The village at which we had arrived, called by the natives Kaayn,
consisted of about forty houses, and was considered as being the
capital of the island, the chiefs of all the other villages assembling
here on the occasion of a general consultation. The _Kota Compania_
was situated near the sea, and like all the others we had met with,
was surrounded by a wall. Above the door of the building, on a half
decayed plank, were carved the following words:--"Ghebout 1773 Mat
Got Halp."[17] The name, which was written under it, was illegible.
In front of the gate of the inclosure was a post, four feet high,
surmounted by a square stone, on which the arms of the Dutch East India
Company were engraved. This had been cleaned and white-washed on our
arrival; and the church, which stood in the centre of the village, was
supplied with a new roof, and otherwise repaired and beautified.

The other villages which the island contains, are all small and of
little importance, and are scattered over the face of the country. As
the land is hilly and covered with rocks, cultivation is not carried on
to a very great extent; indeed, the ground scarcely yields sufficient
for the consumption of the inhabitants: but still there are numerous
fertile spots, which might be rendered productive were the inhabitants
more industrious. A few plantations of sago and cocoa-nut trees, and of
Indian corn and vegetables, were met with in the villages, but these
were the only products that I saw under cultivation. Their domestic
animals consist of goats and hogs, which they sometimes dispose of to
the trading prahus. The forests which cover the island afford materials
wherewith they construct prahus, which were formerly employed in
trading with the neighbouring islands, but since last year their little
bartering trade has been discontinued. At the time of my visit these
poor people possessed no larger vessels than canoes with outriggers,
which they employed in fishing or in carrying them from village to
village; so that it is possible that, for some time past, their voyages
have been confined solely to the coasts of their own island.

The natives do not often employ themselves in fishing, which is much to
be wondered at when it is considered they have a great taste for fish,
while abundance of an excellent quality are to be caught in the waters
which surround their island; of which, indeed, we had sufficient proof
on board the brig, where the seine afforded us a constant supply of the
most delicate fish. The indifference of the natives upon this point,
is perhaps to be attributed to the abundance of wild hogs and birds
which the island affords. Among these is found the _Notenkraker_[18]
(Columba Globicera) hovering in great numbers around the wild nutmeg
trees, of the fruit of which, by the way, they are the only consumers,
the natives having no taste for spices. With a little industry this
article might form a very valuable article of export.

We frequently made shooting excursions into the country during the
early part of the morning, and seldom returned without having shot
some game, or made some interesting discovery. Among the large trees
that clothe the hills, we found abundance of the Kanarie tree, which
produces a fruit similar to the almond, and yielding an oil which the
natives use as butter in the preparation of their simple fare. The
gardens of the inhabitants, which we occasionally visited, were not
well laid out, but still were kept in good order; a proof that with
more inducements to industry, and a better knowledge of agriculture,
they would grow many more useful productions than they do at present.

The northwestern parts of the island are more flat than the others, but
the population is very small. Two or three huts, only, may occasionally
be seen, occupied by the owners or protectors of the sago and cocoa-nut
trees.

On the morning of the 8th of July the chiefs of the different villages
assembled together, and the meeting, like those we had previously
called together on the other island, was conducted with all the
ceremony possible. The good wishes of the government were made known
to them, after which I enquired into their affairs, adjusted their
differences, and had the gratification of finding that my exertions,
though they occupied much time, were attended with the best results. I
flatter myself that our arrival on the island has been of the greatest
service to the good-natured, but uncivilized and half savage islanders;
everything, indeed, shewed that the protecting care of the government
for even its most distant subjects, would make a strong impression on
their minds. They solemnly and thankfully promised that they would
hereafter live in unity, and would punctually follow the advice which
I, in the name of the government, had given to them. Having named the
Upper Orang Kaya and the other chiefs, distributed the presents and
tokens of distinction, and provided them with a Dutch flag to hoist
before their village, I made preparations for my departure.

The squally weather which had prevailed during the previous night
had increased the swell considerably, so that during our return on
board, the boat was twice half filled with water and on the point of
sinking; indeed, it was not without much difficulty that we passed
round. I mention this for the information of those who may hereafter
undertake the same excursion. On a previous occasion I had walked
across the country from the bay in which the brig lay, to Wilhelmus
Bay, and, although the foot-path was by no means a smooth one, leading
continually over hills and mountains, we found the journey rather
pleasant than otherwise, which is especially the case in the cool of
the morning or evening.

At the general assembly, the chiefs brought me two old batons, which
had been presented to some of the late chiefs by the East India
Company; these I returned to their successors. There was no other
engraving upon them than a cypher comprising the initials of the
Dutch East India Company. To the Upper Orang Kaya I gave a new baton,
bearing the arms of the present king. The people earnestly requested
me to leave two soldiers with them to be the representatives of our
government. They evinced great joy when I informed them, that Paulus,
an Amboynese schoolmaster, whom I had brought from Roma for the purpose
of leaving him here were it necessary, should remain among them; and
in a short time they had a small but neat house prepared for him, and
zealously employed themselves in furnishing him with every thing that
was necessary.

I learned from a prayer book which I found among them, and which had
been preserved with the greatest care, that the last visit they had had
from a clergyman took place in the year 1789. The duties of M. Kam,
after so long a lapse, were therefore very arduous, but the people,
though extremely ignorant, appeared to entertain the greatest reverence
for the Christian religion. During our short stay, M. Kam baptized
more than two hundred and fifty people, old as well as young. The new
schoolmaster, Paulus, had been provided with a prayer book, with some
pens, ink and paper, and before our departure he had already commenced
instructing the inhabitants, his labours, as far as we could judge,
promising to be attended with the best results.

On this island we had a still stronger proof than on the others, of
the great attachment the natives shew to our customs and mode of
dress. At the general meeting, all the inhabitants present, men, women
and children, were clad in their festive dresses, and some of their
costumes were of the drollest description. About twenty of the men
wore old felt hats with broad brims, not unlike those used by the
Westphalian peasants. According to their own account, these hats had
been given to their forefathers by the first Europeans who arrived
here and built the fort, the remains of which we had seen. Others
wore extremely old fashioned coats, without any under covering for
their bodies; these garments being so ancient and threadbare, that
they appeared as if a hard shake would cause them to fall to pieces.
These antiquated vestments had been preserved, like Westphalian hams,
by being hung up in the smoke over their fireplaces, and after being
sufficiently dried, had been kept in small chests, by which means they
had remained uninjured by damp or insects.

The 8th of July, the last day of our stay on the island, was spent
in giving them solemn injunctions to live in unity and concord,
after which we took a hearty farewell, the natives expressing their
thankfulness and attachment to the Dutch Government, by repeated shouts
of "Salamat Compania!" and "Salamat Gouvernment!" expressed with the
utmost candour.

I now commissioned the Upper Orang Kaya to keep all the serviceable
prahus in readiness, that they might assist us in towing the brig
out of the harbour, in case there should be any necessity for such
assistance. At two o'clock the following morning, the east wind having
subsided, we weighed anchor and got under sail with a light air from
the northward; after I had fired a signal gun, as agreed on, a large
number of prahus soon made their appearance. A strong swell rolled into
the bay; and as there was very little wind, we did not reach the mouth
of the harbour until half-past five o'clock. The tide experienced among
these islands is very slight, and at the same time very irregular. The
east-south-east wind having set in again, we sent away the prahus that
had been towing us, with many thanks, and worked out of the bay with
short tacks. When under the north shore we were suddenly becalmed,
and the swell was so heavy that the brig drifted rapidly towards the
steep rocky shore, until she was within three ship's lengths of it,
when a breeze arose and carried her clear. It will be advisable for the
mariner to give the northern shore of the bay rather a wide berth, and
to be careful not to get baffled under the high shores.

The small islands to the southward of Damma, together with Teon, an
island lying to the east-north-east, are uninhabited. In the fine
monsoon, turtle in great abundance are caught upon them, especially
the _Karet_ turtle, which yields the shell so much valued for the
manufacture of combs, &c. This animal, which may be sometimes
perceived sleeping on the water, defends itself vigorously when
attacked, with its beak. Its flesh is not so delicate as that of the
sea (or green) turtle, which is also very numerous among these islands,
but the shell of the latter is of little value. The turtle-catchers
lie in wait for them when they come on shore, and take an opportunity
of turning them on their backs, when they cannot rise again. They
sometimes reach the enormous weight of eight hundred pounds. The female
lays her eggs, hundreds at a time, on the sea shore; concerning which I
shall hereafter offer some remarks.

During the east monsoon there is usually fine weather, which stood
us in good stead, as we proceeded from one place to another with
tolerable rapidity. With favourable wind and weather we steered from
Damma towards the island of Lakor, without anything of moment occurring
during the voyage.

CHAPTER VII.

LAKOR.

Description of the Island Lakor.--Coral Banks.--Shyness of the
Inhabitants.--Productions.--Singular Expedition.--Childish
Litigiousness and obstinate Implacability.--Native
Hospitality.--Customs and Dress of the People.

The island Lakor bears a perfect resemblance to a dry coral bank,
raised about twenty feet above the level of the sea. Patches of
sand are only to be met with here and there, and ground fit for the
formation of gardens is even more scarce. The sandy places are planted
with cocoa-nut groves, but besides these there are few large trees;
short plants and shrubs, which are probably of importance only to the
botanist, covering the remainder of the island, except a few parts,
where spots of ground are planted with yams or other roots. Most of
the necessaries of life are imported from the other islands.

Under these circumstances it cannot be expected that the population
of the island is very great. According to the statements of the most
trustworthy islanders it amounts only to between eight hundred and
a thousand souls, but a correct account is not to be looked for, as
the chiefs themselves do not know with exactness the number of their
people. Throughout the island there are only two Christians, the
remainder being all heathens.

With a light south-south-east wind we sailed to the eastward along the
north side of the island, as close as possible to the shore, to look
for a good anchoring place, for the pilot was as little acquainted with
the island as myself. We could not approach sufficiently near to the
easternmost of the two villages which lie here, so we anchored in seven
fathoms, on a patch of sand and stones, off the western one, and moored
the brig with a warp fixed to the reef which lines the shore. The shore
is very steep to, which rendered our anchorage unpleasant and insecure.
This occurs on every part of the north coast of the island. The
inhabitants informed me, that during the west monsoon there is good
anchorage between Moa and Lakor, opposite to the village of Mowai, but
I had no leisure to examine it in person during our stay.

In the evening of the 10th of July, after we had come to an anchor,
I went on shore with the interpreters, when I found, to my great
disappointment, that all the inhabitants had taken flight on our
appearance, with the exception of three aged women, whose language was
totally unintelligible to us. In the course of an hour, after they had
been wandering about the neighbourhood like strayed sheep, several
men approached us, who informed us, as we understood them, that their
chiefs were now upon the island Moa, but would probably return during
the night. This did not appear to be very probable, and I thought it
more likely that they had fled into the interior, which proved to be
the case; for the following day, having left the interpreters on shore
all night to inspire them with confidence, I was fortunate enough to
collect chiefs and people, when I informed them of the purport of my
visit.

This island was formerly under subjection to Moa, and the Orang Tua
resorted to it occasionally, to offer homage to the representatives of
the Dutch Government there; but now every _nigri_, or small district,
was under its own government, and perfectly independent of the chiefs
of Moa. Neither the Dutch East India Company, nor the Government, ever
had a garrison on Lakor. It was on this account that our unexpected
arrival proved so alarming to the natives, and their uneasiness had
been increased by knowing that some of their villages were in a state
of war with each other; a breach of the peace that was always punished
severely in the time of the Company.

It was not without great difficulty that I was enabled to inspire the
natives with confidence, and to this end, whenever good words would
not answer the purpose, I made use of serious threats, which have much
more effect on these ignorant people than any negociations. Lakor was
of too little importance to us for me to remain there long, I therefore
hurried my proceedings as much as possible, and in two days time
every thing was completed. I named a certain Bastiaan Bimar as their
Upper Orang Kaya, and installed the various village chiefs with the
customary solemnities, after which I gave them strong injunctions to
live in peace, unity and subordination to their rulers, and presented
them with some rice, arrack and cloth, together with a Dutch flag, the
latter of which was a very acceptable present.

During my short stay I was constantly employed in deciding all sorts of
petty differences, for the people live in a state of great disunion,
and without the interference of the Government, or of European traders,
they remain obstinately irreconcilable on the slightest quarrel.
Neither do they acknowledge the authority of their chiefs unless they
have been installed by the Dutch Government.

During a journey which I made inland, accompanied by my huntsman and my
interpreter, to endeavour to find some game, and to view the condition
of the interior, my attention was excited by a great number of caves,
containing live pigs, which on this island arrive at a tolerably
large size. We encountered also large flocks of sheep, which form a
most important branch of the wealth of the people. They also possess
buffaloes, but these are chiefly herded on the southern parts of the
island. Throughout the journey I found the ground to consist of hard
coral rocks overgrown with short plants, among which small plantations
of yam and Indian corn were occasionally met with, while the beach was
planted with cocoa-nut trees.

No wells are to be found on the island: the natives, therefore, collect
the water, which falls during the rains, in large pits, where it seems
to keep very well for a long time.

While on the excursion mentioned above, a troop of people, about two
hundred and fifty in number, belonging to the villages on the south
coast of the island, passed by us, every man being armed, as they were
then at war with the people of the northern parts of the island. On
approaching the village they ranged themselves two and two, carrying
themselves with an air of haughtiness, while a man walked at their head
waving an old Dutch flag fastened to the end of a bamboo. Behind him
was borne a chair, on which was placed a baton of the former East India
Company, and an old felt hat, and in the middle of the procession a
child of three years old was carried by a female. I followed them at
a little distance without being observed. On arriving in the village
the chair was placed before the idol, the people squatting round it,
without laying aside their weapons. When I approached them some time
afterwards, I found them in the same position.

The chair, with its contents, had formerly been the property of the
late Orang Kaya of the south coast. The child we had seen was his son,
who was proposed to me as his successor. Until he could fulfil the
office, the Government was entrusted to his uncle.

As usual, the differences among the islanders were soon settled by
me, and the event of this general reconciliation was celebrated by a
great feast, at which they pledged themselves to continued friendship.
The reconciliation between these people was conducted in a similar
manner to that between children who have quarrelled. Having first asked
permission to speak, they commenced blaming and accusing each other,
after which they held out their right hands, and requested me to join
them. This being performed they took a little _siri_ from each other's
boxes, when the ceremony of reconciliation was completed. The elders of
the parties commenced, and they were followed by their juniors, but the
women had nothing to do with the matter, being totally disregarded.

The _siri_ boxes, which are in general use among these islanders, are
made of plaited rushes, their length being five and their breadth four
inches. They are carried behind them, stuck into the _tjedako_ or
waist-belt; and whenever two friends meet, the one takes some _siri_
out of the box of the other.

Another custom obtains among these people, which bears a resemblance to
the universal hospitality of the Arabs. Strangers, who may visit their
island, or touch there during their voyages, are supplied with as many
yams and cocoa-nuts as they can consume, without any remuneration being
expected in return. On more than one occasion I had opportunities of
being an eyewitness to these acts of hospitality. The Orang Kaya of
Mowai, on the island of Moa, being unable to visit me during my stay
on that island, came over to see me on Lakor in his _jonko_, which was
hauled up on the beach, while he took up his residence in a cleft in
the rocks. He had brought no provisions for himself or his people, and
when I asked him how they would maintain themselves, he told me that he
had no difficulty on that point, since he took what he required out of
the plantations of the inhabitants, who would do the same when they
visited him. The rice and other provisions which I gave him during
his stay, were very thankfully received. On my demanding his reason
for thus taking up his residence outside the village, he informed me
that he was not on the best of terms with the people of Lakor, while
at the same time he was acting up to an old usage, their attachment to
which was proved by the fact of two Christians, who were of the party,
refusing, as well as the others, to pass the night in the houses of
their hosts.

Although there were only two Christian inhabitants on the island,
these, like their neighbours of the same persuasion, distinguished
themselves from the others by their mode of dress. The common costume
is much the same throughout the group. That of the men consists of a
_badju_ or loose coat of calico, flowered or striped blue and red, with
pantaloons and _sarong_ of the same materials; while the women wear a
_badju_, and a _sarong_ or petticoat, the upper edge being carelessly
twisted round the waist. The Mohammedans are distinguished from the
others by a handkerchief on the head, arranged like a turban. The
Christians, on the other hand, equally prize an European hat, those
of the upper classes being distinguished by coats, breeches, shoes and
stockings, after our fashion, while the Christians of the lower ranks,
who wear the usual native dress, have their clothes dyed black, those
of the heathens and Mohammedans being invariably of a lighter colour.

CHAPTER VIII.

LUAN.

Arrival at the Island Luan.--Dangerous Passage.--Our Reception by
the People.--Commerce and Fisheries.--The Christians of Luan.--Their
Customs and Dispositions.--Hospitality and Good Nature of the
Inhabitants.--Hazardous Situation on leaving the Island.

After having thus completed our duties on Lakor in as short a time as
possible, we pursued our voyage to Luan, and stood towards the reefs
which enclose that island, with the view of passing over them. Here I
had another opportunity of proving that implicit confidence was not to
be placed in the pilot, who had assured me that he was well acquainted
with the place; for, while standing towards the reefs under easy sail,
our depth suddenly decreased to four fathoms, and the anchor, which
was immediately let go, had scarcely touched the ground, when it was
found that there were only sixteen feet water under the bows. Had it
not been for our cautious mode of proceeding, the brig would assuredly
have been run upon the rocks. Fortunately the wind was favourable, and
the anchor was soon weighed again, when we stood out to sea. The boats
were sent away to look out for a channel, but as none was discovered, I
determined to stand off and on with the brig.

The island Luan, which is about fourteen miles in circumference,
being high, is visible at a considerable distance. An extensive reef,
studded with islets, surrounds it, within which there is a depth of two
fathoms, affording good anchorage to small trading vessels. The islets
to the north-east of Luan are about four miles distant from the main
island. Close outside these the reef is steep to, so that they may be
safely approached by a ship.

Luan is inhabited by from two hundred to three hundred families, who
reside in villages placed very near to each other on the north-east
side of the island, at the foot of the mountain. The adjacent islets
are not peopled, but they are occasionally visited by the inhabitants
of Luan, who have gardens on them, while they also afford a resting
place to those engaged in the trepang fishery.

After we had again got under sail, and I had clearly ascertained that
there was no possibility of our running in over the reef without
incurring the risk of sticking fast, we fired two guns, upon which
two boats put off from the shore, containing the native chiefs, who
came on board to pay their respects. I acquainted them in a few words
with the object of my visit, and promised to go on shore to transact
business on the following day, the 17th of July, when I left the brig
with M. Dielwaart, the secretary and the interpreters, in two boats
manned with European seamen, under a salvo from the guns, and other
customary ceremonies. We soon reached the shore, where we were welcomed
by a number of people of both sexes, who had assembled on the beach to
receive us, and were conducted by them into their villages, which were
only separated from each by stone walls. In the centre village, chairs,
benches and tables had been placed for our accommodation, under the
shelter of awnings composed of boats' sails. We here held a preliminary
meeting of the chiefs, according to the instructions of the Government,
and then took possession of two houses which had been prepared for our
reception, abundance of provisions being supplied us by the people, as
had been the case on the islands we had previously visited.

The inhabitants of Luan, who bear much resemblance to those of Roma,
have arrived at a tolerably high state of civilization. The greater
part take pride in calling themselves Christians; but they nevertheless
live on good terms with the heathens, who here, as elsewhere, are
considered as their subjects and inferiors. The inhabitants reside in
four villages, situated in a line close to each other, each village
having a separate chief. These are exceedingly jealous of each other,
and strangers who visit them must pay especial attention to this
particular, and carefully abstain from taking more notice of one than
of another, since opposite conduct would assuredly lead to serious
discord among these otherwise good-natured and peaceful islanders. This
circumstance rendered the distribution of the Government presents a
matter of greater difficulty than I had found it to be elsewhere.

Traders from Macassar, Amboyna and Banda, annually visit the island
to purchase tortoise-shell and trepang. This last production is here
found of a better quality than on any of the adjacent islands, and
it affords a great source of riches to the natives. The trade of the
island is carried on upon the barter system, specie being little used.
Cloth, which is in great demand, forms the chief import, so that even
European merchants might make great profit by disposing of these
articles here.

The trepang, which is so much sought for by the Chinese, and forms
one of the chief articles of their trade with these parts, is a sort
of sea-slug, of which I shall give a more full description hereafter.
The Chinese consider them as a great delicacy, and they therefore
have as great a taste for them as for the edible birds'-nests, the
last of which are sometimes sold at the rate of four thousand Spanish
dollars the _picul_ (133lbs. avoirdupoise.) When a trader arrives at
Luan for the purpose of obtaining a supply of trepang, he commences by
advancing goods to the natives, in proportions suited to the quantity
he requires. The people then collect, and go out in search of the slug,
which is found in the greatest abundance on the reefs, in from eight
to ten feet water. When the tide is high they are taken by means of a
fork or harpoon, but at low water they are easily caught by the hand.
The fishery, which is only continued until a sufficient quantity has
been obtained to supply the trader, rarely lasts more than three or
four days, and it can only be followed with good success during the
change of the monsoon. They never keep a stock in hand; and should
no traders arrive among them during the year, the fishery is totally
neglected. They have, indeed, but few inducements to carry it on with
vigour, for a single fishing excursion will supply their wants. It is
surprising that the people of the neighbouring islands do not come here
occasionally to partake of the abundance of trepang which the reefs
afford; for, although the people of Luan claim the exclusive privilege
of fishing in the surrounding waters, they take little trouble in
preserving it. The traders, whose capital consists of cloth, iron
ware, gongs, &c., obtain the trepang at the rate of from twenty to
twenty-five guilders the _picul_, and therefore make an enormous profit
on disposing of it to the Chinese. Hogs and goats also form an article
of export from Luan. The first, especially, are fattened without much
difficulty or expense, on the shells of young cocoa-nuts and on the
pith of the sago-tree.

Fowls and ducks are in such abundance on the island, that the natives
care little about taking the fish which swarm in the adjacent waters.
Their habitations, like those of their neighbours, are very small,
rarely exceeding twenty feet in length and ten in breadth. The roofs
are thatched with the leaves of the palm-tree, which is found to resist
the rays of the sun better than tiles or slates, while at the same
time it affords perfect shelter from the rains which fall almost daily
during the west monsoon. The floor of the house is raised four or five
feet from the ground on wooden piles; and the interior, which contains
only a few benches, and a stone fire-place for cooking their simple
meals, is lighted by holes in the walls and roof, and by two doors, one
at each end of the house, which are left open night and day.

Although among the inhabitants there are many who call themselves
Christians, there is no building exclusively appropriated to worship,
divine service being usually performed in one of the largest of the
houses. Very few of them can read or write, and their knowledge of
our religion consists only in doctrines that have been handed down
from father to son. During our stay M. Kam baptized more than one
hundred and fifty of these islanders, and united several couples in
matrimony. It was laughable to see the men and women, young and old,
taking my seamen by the arm, and dragging them to the spot where the
religious ceremonies were being performed, that they might become their
godfathers. The sailors, who, for the most part, were lively young
men, put rather a long face on the matter; but I must say it to their
praise, that they behaved with the greatest respectability, and never
forgot themselves for a moment. As my men always conducted themselves
well, I willingly allowed them recreation on shore; and experience
has proved to me that those who have the least indulgence of this
description, are always the most difficult to manage.

During the 17th, 18th, and 19th of July, I was constantly employed
in arranging the affairs of the people of Luan, and in renewing the
friendship which formerly existed between them and ourselves. In the
name of the Government I distributed the presents, confirmed the chiefs
in their governments with the customary solemnities, and drew up their
certificates of appointment. Many of the batons presented to former
chiefs by the old East India Company, were still in the possession of
the natives, together with their certificates, the latest of which bore
the date of 1777, so that in all probability the island had not been
visited by a Dutchman for a period of nearly fifty years.

It appeared to me to be very remarkable, that they stedfastly refused
to permit my appointing any one as their head chief. In spite of all my
arguments in favour of such an appointment, they continued obstinate,
and it would not have been possible for me to succeed, unless I had
resorted to absolute command. They assured me that up to this time they
had always lived in peace and unity under the separate government of
their various chiefs, and I therefore allowed them to have their own
way, which appeared to give universal satisfaction. I subsequently
endeavoured to induce them to carry their goods for sale to Amboyna
or Banda, and gave them other advice which had for its object the
increase of their prosperity; and I had the satisfaction of perceiving
that they duly appreciated it. Men and women showed a confidence
in, and friendship towards, our Government, which I should find it
difficult to describe in appropriate terms. At the general meetings
some of them often came forward, and, kissing my hand, entreated that
the Government would hereafter bear them in remembrance, and take an
active part in the management of their affairs. I promised them that
I would faithfully inform our colonial rulers of their numerous good
qualities, and would at the same time request that a teacher should be
sent to them to instruct their children in useful knowledge, and in the
observances of the Christian faith.

The day before my departure from the island, the armed seamen were
sent on board, to the great regret of the people, who earnestly
requested me to stay a few days longer. Their farewells to our seamen
were truly affecting; and those only who are acquainted with the warm
dispositions of these people, can conceive how strong a friendship had
grown up between them and us in so short a time. When, at length, on
the afternoon of the 19th of July, I prepared to return on board, I
was accompanied by at least seven-eighths of the people. Amid repeated
good wishes they conducted us to our boats, showing us every attention
in their power. They carried us into the boats on litters, and I was
here again detained some time by the fair islanders, young and old, who
crowded around me to take leave.

The proofs of friendship, confidence and regard, which all my fellow
voyagers, as well as myself, experienced from the people of Luan, were
greater than any we had met with elsewhere. The continued kindness of
these islanders was the more striking, from its bearing undeniable
marks of sincerity; indeed, it perfectly accorded with their usual
conduct, for I never met with more harmony, contentment and toleration,
more readiness to afford mutual assistance, more domestic peace and
happiness, nor more humanity and hospitality, than among the simple
inhabitants of Luan.

On the day of my departure a strong south-east wind arose and created
a turbulent sea, for which reason the islanders wished me to delay
my departure; but having once made up my mind to go, I entered the
boat and put off for the brig. Some _prahus_ endeavoured to accompany
me, but the sea run so high that these were forced to return; and I
continued with the boat alone. When we crossed the outside of the
reef the boat was already half full, and it was not without much
danger and difficulty that we reached the brig, by which time we were
just upon the point of sinking. The other boat, in which M. Kam was
embarked, remained on shore until the following day, when it came off,
accompanied by many of our native friends, who, in addition to the
kindness they had already shown us, brought us presents of all sorts
of fruits and refreshments which the island afforded. It was perfectly
impossible to refuse them, and I returned the compliment as well as I
could, by presenting them with various articles that I thought might be
useful to them.

On the 19th of July we stood away from the island, impressed
with strong feelings of thankfulness for the unconstrained and
straightforward kindness of its peaceable and fortunate inhabitants.
None but those who have been placed in a like situation can form a
conception of the feelings we experienced, when this happy island faded
from our view.

CHAPTER IX.

BABA.

Voyage towards Banda.--Remarks on the Islands Sermatta, Teon and
Nila.--Arrival at Banda.--Humanity of an Orang-Kaya.--Description of
the Island Baba.--Great Fear and Distrust of the Inhabitants.--Their
Manners and Customs.--The Island Wetang.--Cause of the Distrust of
the Natives.--Murderous and plundering Propensities of the People of
Aluta.--Disturbances between the Inhabitants of Tepan and Aluta.

From the hospitable island of Luan we steered our course for Banda.
Nothing worthy of remark occurred during the voyage; but I will take
this opportunity of making a few remarks on some islands which lay near
our route, and which, many years past, were in connection with our
Government.

The island Sermatta is composed of a high ridge of hills, extending
east and west, the sides of which run steep off into the sea. As
the island is thinly inhabited, and at the same time affords no
shelter to shipping, it is of little importance to strangers. The
inhabitants are under subjection to the people of Luan, to which island
they bring rice, edible roots, Indian corn and cattle, receiving in
exchange cloth, and other necessary articles. During my stay at Luan
I endeavoured, without success, to induce some of these islanders to
come with me; they appeared to be very shy and fearful, which is not
surprising when it is taken into consideration that their island is
never visited by trading vessels, while the people themselves do not
extend their voyages beyond Luan.

Teon, to the east-north-east of Damma, is hilly, and of moderate
height. It is uninhabited, and the channel between it and Nila is
rendered very unsafe by a number of reefs, which require the greatest
precaution on the part of the navigator, should he attempt to pass
through it.

The island Nila consists of a high round hill, on the north side of
which there is anchorage for small vessels. It is inhabited by a few
heathens, who, at the changing of the monsoons, visit Banda to dispose
of their hogs, fowls and cocoa-nuts, which appear to form the sole
products of the island.

On the 22nd of July we anchored in the Roads of Banda, where we
received on board provisions and water, and were provided with a fresh
supply of goods as presents to the native chiefs. During our stay we
experienced some heavy squalls from off the island of Great Banda, with
very rainy weather.

At the request of the Resident, M. Camphuyzen, I took with me two
English seamen, named William Both and Joseph Atkins. These men had
belonged to the English brig _Syren_, Captain William Johns, which had
been wrecked on the coast of New Guinea, where the crew fell into the
hands of the barbarous inhabitants. They were sold and resold among
the natives of the neighbouring islands, until at length these two men
reached the island Kower, where the Orang Kaya of Kisser[19] purchased
them and brought them to Banda. For this humane act the Resident, in
the name of the Government, presented the chief with a gold medal.

At noon, on the 28th of July, we left the Roads of Banda, and had again
to struggle against heavy squalls, with a high sea from the south-east.
I was therefore obliged to stand to the southward towards the island
Baba, and as we stood on this course the swell gradually decreased, and
the weather became more favourable. We had the current in our favour
when we arrived among the islands to the southward of Banda, so that we
experienced no difficulty in working up to windward. The careful manner
in which it is necessary to proceed, however, caused us much delay. In
the charts now existing, most of the islands are either placed wrong,
or are entirely left out, while at the same time our pilots were not
perfectly acquainted with the channels.

Proceeding thus cautiously, we did not reach Baba until the 4th of
August. This island, which is hilly and tolerably high, is surrounded
by several smaller islets, the most important of which are Wetang to
the east, and Dain to the north. The best anchorage near Baba during
the east monsoon, is on the west side of the island off the village of
Tepa, and in steering towards this we ran close along the north shore
of Wetang, and then stood over to Baba, when we worked up close under
the land to the anchorage, and brought up in fifteen fathoms, with very
good holding ground. Care is necessary in working up to the anchorage
during this monsoon, as heavy squalls sometimes come off the land.
When the westerly winds prevail, it is said that the most secure roads
are under the coast of Wetang; but as I was not here at that period, I
had no opportunity of personally ascertaining the fact.

While we were standing under easy sail towards the roads, small prahus
with outriggers, containing three or four men each, occasionally rowed
towards us, the people hailing us from a distance to inquire who we
were, and whether we intended to do them harm. Our endeavours to induce
them to come on board were fruitless; nor did I, indeed, succeed in
this until after the interpreters had been among them, and set their
fears at rest. On arriving at the village I found that the inhabitants
had totally deserted it, and had even taken their household goods with
them. Not a woman nor a child was to be seen, but the men, with their
arms in their hands, were perceived running through the bush at a
distance.

The natives who first came on board were very timorous, and either
through fear or ignorance could scarcely make themselves understood
in Malay.[20] After I had made them a few presents, and acquainted
them with the object of my visit, they went on shore, impressed with
greater confidence in our intentions towards them, while the fears
of those on shore were at the same time quieted by the interpreters.
They returned on board soon afterwards, accompanied by the chiefs of
the village and two of the oldest inhabitants, who brought with them
one of the silver-knobbed batons, which were formerly distributed by
the East India Company. With much confusion of manner they informed us
that they had never seen an European during their lives, but that their
forefathers had often spoken in high terms of the Dutch, and stated
that they had been of old subjected to their East India Company. They
moreover informed us, that they had at all times looked forward with
the greatest eagerness to the period when their old friendship and
alliance with our Government would be renewed.

When these chiefs left the brig, I sent the interpreters on shore
with them, provided with arrack and tobacco to distribute among
the islanders, and to do all in their power towards quieting their
fears. At noon I followed them in person, and found that the women
and children had not yet returned to their houses, but ere long a
number of them assembled around us. The people made free use of the
arrack and tobacco, and gradually laid aside their fears, when I made
them acquainted with the object of my visit, and informed them that
I desired nothing from them, but came here at the command of our
Government to do all in my power towards promoting their interests. I
also testified my astonishment at the timidity and want of confidence
they had displayed, and admonished them to cause their wives and
families to return to their homes, as otherwise I should be unable to
view them as friends.

Throughout the Molucca Islands the absence of the women and children
from the villages may always be held as a convincing proof of bad
intentions on the part of the natives. Violence on their part
generally, however, arises more from their ignorance, fear, and
consequent want of confidence, than from decided malevolence.
Experience has already often proved to me that whenever affairs stand
thus with the natives, the higher the tone of command with which
you address them, the more you will inspire them with respect. I
therefore made no difficulty of going ashore among them, unarmed and
unaccompanied, and when I found that my words began to make some
impression on them, I placed before their eyes the impropriety of
their want of confidence, and soon had the satisfaction to see them
unanimously lay aside their weapons, and behave with greater freedom.
In the evening I again went on shore, accompanied by several of the
gentlemen, when I found that the women and children had returned to
the village, and I never afterwards saw the least signs of distrust
among them; indeed, their familiarity soon went so far that I was often
obliged to spread the boarding nettings, when I did not wish to have
the brig full of curious visitors.

The population of Baba is divided into two portions, one inhabiting
the side of the island on which we lay, and the other taking up
its residence on the south-east side, the interior being entirely
unpeopled. These two parties have been long in a state of war, making
frequent plundering excursions against each other, the chief object
of these being the acquirement of captives, who are either kept as
slaves by the conqueror, or are sold to the traders who visit the
island. The population is not very great, but the exact amount cannot
be ascertained. Each of the tribes is governed by an Orang Kaya,
elected from among the richest and oldest of the inhabitants. Tepa,
the village before which we anchored, consisting of no more than
twenty-five houses, is considered as the capital of the western tribe;
but they also have dwellings on the island Wetang, while many others
are scattered among the gardens in the vicinity.

The manners, customs, &c. of the people of Baba resemble those of the
heathen inhabitants of the islands we had already visited. Their hair
is of a reddish, flaxen colour, its natural blackness having been thus
changed by rubbing lime into the head, which process is commenced when
they are yet in their infancy.[21]

The western side of Baba is so precipitous and overgrown with forest,
that cultivation has extended but very little; the more fertile island
Wetang being selected as a more suitable spot for their plantations
of roots, Indian corn and vegetables. The neighbouring waters supply
excellent fish, abundance of which were daily caught by our seamen
with the seine. The natives, however, pay little heed to the bounty
which the sea affords. The interior of the island is overrun with wild
cattle, hogs and goats, the woods at the same time being well stocked
with feathered game. Among the last was a kind of wood pigeon, which
roosted in immense numbers in the trees, and afforded much sport in the
morning to myself and the surgeon, who was also a lover of field sports.

On the south side of Tepa I met with the remains of a stronghold, but
the natives could give me no information concerning the period of its
erection. Near the same spot we also found a fine well, enclosed by
masonry, which, although now in a state of disrepair, bore evident
marks of having been constructed in a superior manner. The water
it contained was beautifully clear and pure, so that we took the
opportunity of filling up our empty water casks.

The natives live in a state of great poverty, but as their wants
are few they are contented. A native vessel from Banda visits them
only once or twice a year, to supply them with cotton cloth, which
is almost the only article of foreign manufacture they require. They
have, therefore, but little communication with strangers, which easily
accounts for their being far inferior in point of civilization to
the natives of the islands we had previously visited. Their vessels
consist of long prahus of from ten to twelve tons burthen, which are
employed in visiting the neighbouring islands; and of small canoes,
which are used for shorter voyages. Their arms are bows, arrows, iron
javelins, and bamboo spears, while they possess also a few muskets,
which they preserve with great care, but evidently intend more for
show than use, as many are unprovided with locks. The women perform
the heaviest portion of the labour, the industry of the men being only
displayed in gathering cocoa-nuts, making palm wine, and repairing
their weapons, without which they never go abroad. I never went on a
shooting excursion into the interior without meeting with parties of
armed men, going to, or returning from, their plantations. Nearly every
man was accompanied by a dog, who, by his barking, gives his master
warning of the approach of a stranger. On one occasion, early in the
morning, I encountered in the forest a couple who afforded me some
amusement. The man, who was naked, with the exception of a cloth round
the loins, carried a large bow, a bundle of arrows with broad points
of iron, a klewang or hanger by his side, and was preceded by his dog,
while his wife, clad as lightly as her husband, brought up the rear,
bearing a musket and a large basket of yams on her shoulders. They
tarried awhile with me to partake of some arrack and tobacco which I
offered them, and as I always had an interpreter with me, I enquired
whither they were going, and why so heavily armed? He informed me that
they were bound for their plantations, and that it was necessary to
go well armed, as they must show a good front against neighbours, who
often fell upon them and robbed them of their wives; while at the same
time they were liable to attacks from the wild beasts. The musket was
unloaded, and had no lock; but it was perhaps as serviceable as if it
had one, for he was afraid to fire off my fowling piece. They make up,
however, for this deficiency by their skill in using the bow and arrow,
with which I have frequently seen them strike a bird on a tree at a
distance of fifty or sixty paces.

I frequently held communications with the chiefs, on which occasions
I was always surrounded by the entire population, and had many
opportunities of witnessing the docility of these islanders, and how
open they are to conviction. They would willingly place themselves
under the control of a mild government, and with such an advantage
I feel convinced that they would even lay aside their barbarous
customs, and adopt a more quiet, orderly and industrious mode of
life. If traders now and then suffer wrong at their hands, I believe
that, in most cases, their own conduct has been the cause of it;
since it has often come under my notice that the Amboynese and Banda
traders frequently take advantage of their superior knowledge and
experience, to lord it over the islanders, and cheat them of their
goods, the simplicity of the latter rendering them an easy prey. If
it were known how often strangers leave them without fulfilling their
commercial engagements, the artless natives would readily be excused
for occasionally taking a wild justice for their wrongs, and viewing
all strangers with suspicion.

When among the islands which we visited during the previous part of
the voyage, I had heard that an English vessel had been cut off by the
natives of Baba, and it was not without the greatest difficulty that I
succeeded in gaining some of the particulars concerning it from a few
of the natives. It appeared that some months previous to my visit, an
English trading brig, manned with ten European seamen, which had been
bartering muskets and ammunition for tortoise-shell and cattle among
the islands to the eastward of Timor, anchored off Aluta, the capital
of the tribe inhabiting the east side of Baba, and the commander,
supposing the people to be as trustworthy as those of the other
islands, sent half his crew ashore in the boat to obtain water, at a
time when a large number of natives were on board the brig carrying on
a trade. While the boat was away, the natives, for some unknown reason,
attacked the commander and the four remaining seamen, and, although
armed only with their knives, succeeded in killing them, which fate
also befel the boat's crew on their return on board. The brig was then
run on shore, plundered, and burnt. The greater part of her cargo,
consisting of arms, tortoise-shell and cattle, together with her sails
and rigging, which had been divided among the captors, were still in
their possession.[22]

A trading prahu from Banda, which afterwards visited Aluta, was also
cut off by the natives, and all her crew murdered with the exception of
two individuals, one of whom was subsequently taken away by another
trading prahu, while the other still remained on the island, having
married the daughter of one of the chiefs; from which there is reason
for supposing that he was accessary to the deed.

After the people of Tepa had related to me these particulars, many of
them came forward and kissed my hands, requesting me not to consider
them as accomplices in the crime, as they never wished to have any
communication with the people of the back part of the island. They
declared that nothing would please them more than that I should go to
Aluta, and assist them in chastising its treacherous inhabitants.

I endeavoured, by the promise of presents, and of entire forgiveness
to the people of the east coast, to induce the chiefs of Tepa to visit
Aluta, and bring back with them one of the head men of the place; but
in this I was unsuccessful. To my great regret, therefore, I was unable
to do any thing in the affair; for there was no path by which I could
reach Aluta overland, and it would have been unadviseable, at this
period of the year, to have proceeded there with the brig, while the
length of the distance, and the insufficiency of their force in case
of disturbance, prevented our sending the boats. The chiefs frequently
promised me that they would send a prahu there, to inform the people
of the desire I had to see them make up their differences, and in
the faith of this promise, from which nothing resulted, I delayed my
departure from the island several days.

On the 8th, having called together the chiefs, I went on shore under
an escort of twenty marines, and with the accustomed ceremonies,
to read to them the communications sent to them by our Government,
which I explained to them in the fullest manner. All appeared to be
much moved at the friendly intentions and offers of assistance and
protection expressed in the letter, and stated that nothing could
better agree with their wishes than that they should be placed under
the rule of the Dutch Government, to whom they would become faithful
subjects. They assured me that they all felt convinced that this was
the only course that could lead to their future prosperity, while they
were at the same time aware, that in point of civilization they were
inferior to many of their neighbours, which they themselves ascribed
to the anarchy which had prevailed among them during a long series of
years, and to the disappearance of the Christian religion from among
them, through the decease of those who had professed it. They also
requested me, in the most earnest manner, to appoint some clever and
experienced men from among them, to the chieftainship, and also to send
them an Amboynese missionary or teacher, to instruct them in the tenets
of Christianity, expressing deep regret at their having relapsed to
paganism and wickedness, from the state of Christian harmony in which
their forefathers had passed their lives.

In accordance with the general wishes of the people, I appointed a
certain _Tompatti Paulus_ as the Upper Orang-kaya of the west coast
of Baba, and presented him with a silver-knobbed baton, and a large
Dutch flag. After this I drew up provisional acts of appointment for
the minor chiefs of villages. These solemnities, at which the entire
population of Tepa were present, were held in the middle of the
village, the audience sitting on benches and mats, those appropriated
to the chief individuals being sheltered by an awning of prahus'
sails. After the breaking up of these meetings, they usually offered
up sacrifices of cattle to their idols, and passed the entire night
carousing.

At this last meeting they declared that they would commence the
proposed voyage to the back of the island the same night, and I
promised to delay my departure until their return; but either from
fear, or from some reason which I could not discover, they again
disappointed me. On the following morning, however, four _Orang Baays_,
or large canoes, made their appearance, manned with from thirty to
forty men each, and literally crammed full of weapons. After rowing
round the brig several times, firing shots occasionally from such of
their muskets as were in a serviceable state, they came alongside with
a loud shout, when the Upper Orang-kaya, and several other chiefs, came
on board, and, as subjects to the Netherlands' Government, offered
their vessels for our use, to make a voyage to the back of the island.
I expressed my surprise at this extraordinary equipment, and thanking
them for the readiness they had shown, informed them that I always
wished, in the first instance, to take kind and humane measures for
bringing offenders back to their duty, and had no object in resorting
to hostilities against their fellow islanders. As I could afford
to spend no more time on the island, and the state of the monsoon
prevented me from going with the brig to the back of the island, I
determined to leave the affair to the decision of the Government.
I was the more necessitated to leave the differences between these
tribes unsettled, from it being evident that an expedition to and from
Aluta could not be performed in less than ten days. I exhorted them,
in the mean time, to become reconciled to their neighbours as soon as
possible; to inform them of the kindness and good intentions of our
Government; and to prevail upon them to go to Banda to ask forgiveness
for the offences they had committed, failing which they would assuredly
be punished for their neglect.

While we lay off Tepa a number of canoes came daily alongside, loaded
with fowls, hogs, fruit and vegetables, to sell to the ship's company.
A fowl was given for an empty bottle; two or three for a common pocket
knife; while the price of a hog of from twelve to fifteen pound weight,
was a small quantity of calico, or a piece of coarse red chintz
lining-stuff, of the value of a couple of guilders (3*s.* 4*d.*) As
on the adjacent islands, money is not valued by the natives, with the
exception of gold coin, which they melt down and form into ear-rings or
other ornaments. Men as well as women have often three or four holes
bored, one above the other, in their ears, in each of which they wear a
golden ornament.

Atkins, one of the English seamen we had taken on board at Banda,
died here, in consequence of the fatigues he had endured during his
captivity among the natives. When the people of Baba heard of his
decease, they immediately offered to provide a coffin, and to bring him
on shore; but for particular reasons, among which was a fear that they
might disinter the body after our departure, I preferred committing it
to the deep with the usual ceremony.

Early in the morning of the 15th of August we weighed anchor and left
the island, amid the farewells of the people, who had assembled on the
beach to witness our departure.

CHAPTER X.

THE ARRU ISLANDS.

Daai Island.--Singular Change in the Colour of the Sea.--Festivities
on Board.--The Arru Islands.--Description of these remarkable
Regions.--Customs of the Arafuras.--Total Absence of Religion.--Proofs
of the Mildness of their Form of Government.--Singular Treatment of

We ran along the coast of Baba under small sail, with the wind
east-south-east, having squalls occasionally coming off the land. On
rounding the point, we opened a high peak on the east side of the
island. At noon we passed to the westward of Daai, a high island,
slightly wooded, extending nearly east and west about four miles, on
the north side of which there is a small inlet affording good anchorage
for small vessels. The inhabitants, about one hundred in number,
are very wild and evil-disposed, and are under subjection to the
Orang-kaya of the west coast of Baba, to whom they deliver the produce
of their industry, chiefly live stock, at fixed prices.

On the forenoon of the 13th we passed Serua, an island thinly
populated, and not very accessible for vessels. The people, who are
heathens, and independent of the other islanders, visit Banda every
year at the change of the monsoons, to dispose of their hogs and goats.

We now had the breeze unusually strong, with a high sea, and a current
setting to the north-west. For two nights since the waters of the sea
had had a curious white appearance, which at first excited little
notice, but on the night of the 13th, as the breeze freshened from
the east-south-east, this peculiar appearance increased until the sea
possessed the colour of milk. This phenomenon was accompanied by thick
drizzling rain, so that by ten o'clock P.M. nothing was visible but
the dismal brightness of the waters around us. On board the brig the
atmosphere was so dark, that we could not distinguish each other at
a distance of three paces, and never having seen a like phenomenon,
we were not a little surprised. The wind continued to blow strongly
until two o'clock A.M., when the atmosphere began to clear up, so
that at length we began to recognize one another's countenances. The
strange appearance of the water continued until the break of day, and
even afterwards it continued white and troubled. During the night, and
also on the subsequent day, I took up some of the water in a clean
glass, that I might examine it with a microscope; but I found it to
be entirely free from dirt or animalculæ, though it still retained a
clear, sparkling whiteness. On several subsequent occasions, especially
during the night, we remarked a similar appearance, but not to so great
an extent as on the one above-mentioned; I am therefore led to suppose
that the strength of the wind materially contributed to it. The pilots,
who had been acquainted with these seas for several years, informed me
that they had never previously witnessed this appearance to so great
an extent as at present, which may, perhaps, be owing to their never
performing their voyages when the monsoon is blowing its full strength.
They were, indeed, as much alarmed as astonished at seeing us beat the
brig to windward; but I must here remark, that the _Dourga_ was a very
fast and weatherly sea-boat.

In consequence of the current, which usually sets with the wind, and
runs with great strength about the parallel of Banda, we were driven
so far to leeward, that we were forced to pass to the northward of
the Matabella Islands; after leaving which we were enabled to make
much better way, but still found it a matter of difficulty to work up
against the monsoon.

It was my intention to run as close as possible along the coast of New
Guinea, but I was unable to effect my object. On the 22nd we made Pulo
Adi, a low and thinly peopled island, lying to the north of the Great
Ki, near to the mainland of New Guinea.

On the 24th of August we celebrated the anniversary of our beloved
King's birthday. The distance which separates them from their
fatherland, renders this holiday doubly interesting to all true hearted
Netherlanders, being not only a tribute of love to their King, but
also a renewal of dear associations connected with their homes. At
the rising of the sun, a salute from our guns announced the arrival
of this national holiday. The masts were adorned with flags, and all
the seamen, clad in their best array, attended divine service, after
which a grand parade was performed, enlivened by the old national hymn,
"_Wilhelmus van Nas sauwen_," the remainder of the day being spent in
amusements. The weather favoured the celebration of the feast, and
space was made upon the deck for games and dances,[23] as I willingly
allowed my brave crew to enjoy themselves to the fullest extent,
placing full confidence in them and their officers. I cannot refrain
from here making honourable mention of Lieutenant Brennwald, who, on
these and all other occasions, fully responded to the confidence I
reposed in his circumspection, calmness and seamanship. The anniversary
was spent by the seamen, in this far distant region of the globe, with
very lively, and indeed with boisterous joy; but the day closed without
any one having committed the least excess.

On the 26th we arrived off the Arru Islands. The westernmost islands of
this group, (Wama, Wokan, Maykor, and Wadia,) are inhabited, the three
first by Christians, and the latter by Mohammedans, the eastern isles
being occupied by Arafuras, who live under the control of the others.

Since our departure from the Matabella Islands, we had experienced a
set of current to the westward of twenty-four miles, which would render
it impossible for an inferior sailing vessel to beat up to the Arru
Islands during the east monsoon. Under the guidance of our pilot, but
with the precaution of having our boats a-head, we ran along the west
coasts of Wadia and Wokan; and on the 27th came to an anchor off Wokan,
about cannon-shot from the shore, opposite the village of Wanla. The
chiefs of the people came on board to welcome us, as well as those of
the neighbouring islands, all of whom evinced the liveliest joy at our
arrival.

Were I to describe the different islands as I visited them, I should be
betrayed into unnecessary length, as the islands so much resemble one
another; I will, therefore, by way of shortening the narrative, enter
at once into the description of the Arru Islands generally, omitting
those particulars connected with channels, currents, &c. which would be
of use only to the navigator.

In the time of the old East India Company, the Arru Islands were
garrisoned by a party of Dutch soldiers; and on Wokan there was then
a fine fort. While Amboyna and Banda engrossed the entire trade of
these islands, the inhabitants of the two settlements were in a state
of great prosperity, but now the Arrus are visited yearly by about
thirty paduakans of from fifty to one hundred and twenty tons burthen
(twenty-five to sixty lasten), from Macassar, Boni, and other places,
from whom the natives obtain goods by barter, and at so cheap a rate,
that the traders of Amboyna and Banda are unable to compete with them.

The Arru Islands, when viewed from a distance, appear low, but small
green elevations occasionally show themselves among the limestone
rocks. These islands, in all probability, owe their origin to a
small archipelago of limestone rocks, between which the _polypes_,
uninterrupted in their labour by heavy seas, have built up their coral
branches to the surface of the water, during the prevalence of the
westerly monsoon; and drying during other monsoons, owing to the tides
being much lower, their habitations have formed a coral bank or reef.
Some of the masses of plants, which are always floating about these
seas, may have lodged on the reef and taken root, in which case the
decayed vegetable matter, arising from their fallen leaves, together
with sea-weed and other rubbish which may be washed upon them, would
soon form a low morassy soil. The islands are separated from each other
by channels of salt water. The centre of these is called _Sunghy_
Kobi-Wato, the northernmost Sunghy Maba-Wato, and the southernmost
Sunghy Maykor-Wato.

Little or no information can be gathered from the charts, concerning
the position, the number or the names of the Arru Islands. Valentyn
laid them down very incorrectly, and was uncertain how far they
extended to the eastward.

The Arafuras, who are the aborigines of the islands, form a numerous
body of people. They are not, as is generally supposed, entirely
uncivilized, since they live in villages, containing ten or twelve
houses each, under the control of their elders. Their food consists
chiefly of fish and hogs, which they shoot with iron-pointed arrows.
They also grow excellent vegetables, Indian corn, _labu_ (a sort of
pumpkin, resembling the turnip in flavour), sugar-cane, together with
a little red and white rice. Their clothing is not more costly than
their food. The men wear a strip of white, blue or coloured calico
round the waist, one end being brought between the legs, and fastened
on one side with a knot; and adorn themselves with armlets made from
white shells, with small pieces of brass wire in four or five holes,
pierced above one another in the ears, and with beads around the neck.
Their hair is usually black, and strongly curled. As I have remarked
elsewhere, they wash it with ash or lime-water, which imparts to it a
lightish colour and causes it to appear rough, both these peculiarities
being considered very tasteful by the Arafuras, and also by the Papuas
(the inhabitants of the coasts of New Guinea.) Some of these, who
have very long hair, twist it up into a knot at the back of the head,
confining it by means of a bamboo comb. Nearly all their head-dresses
are adorned by some strings of coral beads extending from both ears,
and meeting over their forehead. They always carry a chopping knife
thrust through their waist-cloth.

The women wear a chain girdle, made of thick brass wire, round the
waist, the ends fastened by a hook, from which a small piece of cloth,
generally of Macassar _sarong_ stuff, hangs down in front, a square
piece of fine matting depending in like manner from behind; these
forming their sole covering. The numerous strings of coral beads, which
they wear round the neck, hang down upon the breast, and are triced
up to each ear, which has by no means an ungraceful appearance. The
entire lobe of the ear is pierced with numerous holes, through which
are drawn pieces of copper and tin, and sometimes a species of marine
plant, this last being also often used as armlets. Under the knee and
above the elbow they wear bands of fine plaited cane, through which
they often draw the leaves of a certain plant. The hair of the women is
very long and fine, and in general but slightly curled. They plait it
in different sections, and twist the whole up into a knot on the top of
the head. Their colour is black or transparent brown (_doorschijnend
bruin_.)

Among the Arafuras the greater portion of the labour is performed by
the women; they carry water, cut wood, cure trepang, catch the crabs
and shell fish, and prepare the meals, carrying their young children at
their back while pursuing their avocations.

Although I can hardly coincide with the opinion entertained by one of
my officers, who had visited these islands in 1824 with M. Bik, that
the Arafuras had no religion whatsoever, I will here insert some of the
observations he made, as contributing greatly to give a knowledge of
these people. The facts he relates are not to be doubted.

"Although," says he, "I found in a house at Old Affara (a village on
Vorkay, one of the southernmost of the Arrus) an image rudely formed
of wood, together with a post on which different figures, such as
snakes, lizards, crocodiles and human forms were carved, and which the
owner stated to be intended for preserving the house from evil spirits
(_Swangi_), yet it is evident that the Arafuras of Vorkay possess no
religion whatsoever. There are no sacred groves or similar places on
the island. They certainly hold a feast at the time in which they have
perceived that the Christians of Wama hold one also, namely, at the
commencement of the year, when they, in imitation of the Christians,
celebrate the Advent of the new year, by arraying themselves in their
best clothes, and drinking a considerable quantity of arrack.

"Of the immortality of the soul they have not the least conception.
To all my enquiries on this subject they answered, 'No Arafura has
ever returned to us after death, therefore we know nothing of a future
state, and this is the first time we have heard of it.' Their idea was,
_Mati, Mati sudah_, (When you are dead there is an end of you.) Neither
have they any notion of the creation of the world. They only answered,
'None of us are aware of this; we have never heard any thing about it,
and therefore do not know who has done it all.'

"To convince myself more fully respecting their want of knowledge of a
Supreme Being, I demanded of them on whom they called for help in their
need, when, far from their homes, engaged in the trepang fishery, their
vessels were overtaken by violent tempests, and no human power could
save them, their wives and children from destruction. The eldest among
them, after having consulted the others, answered that they knew not on
whom they could call for assistance, but begged me, if I knew, to be so
good as to inform them.

"I was at length tired of asking questions, and did my best to give
them a notion of the creation of the world, and of a future state. I
remarked to them how wonderful it was that a small grain of seed sprang
up into a spreading tree; that the different sorts never mixed; that
every thing which surrounded us was in a constantly progressive state
of creation and decay; and that all these things could never have
taken place but for the superintendence of an allwise Providence. The
Arafuras nodded their heads to show that my words appeared to them to
have much truth in them.

"At length one of them, who had listened with particular attention,
demanded of me where this all-ruling Being took up its abode. I
answered, that the Deity was present everywhere, not only among us, but
in every plant that, through his goodness and power, he has furnished
us for our food. This idea was too abtruse for the Arafuras; for one of
them answered--'Then this God is certainly in your arrack, for I never
feel happier than when I have drunk plenty of it.'"

It is certainly worthy of remark, that these simple Arafuras, without
hope of reward, or fear of punishment after death, live in such peace
and brotherly love with one another; and that they recognize the right
of property, in the fullest sense of the word, without there being any
authority among them than the decisions of their elders, according to
the customs of their forefathers, which are held in the highest regard.
During my stay among them, I never perceived the least discord, either
among themselves or with their neighbours in the adjacent villages,
which, one would suppose, might naturally take place from the clashing
of their interests in the trepang fishery, or from their appetite
for strong drink. This last is the chief, if not the sole, vice which
exists among them.

No Arafura can take unto himself a wife until he has delivered the
marriage present, which consists of elephant's teeth, brass gongs,
cloth, &c., which is not usually all paid at once, but by instalments
during several years. A father, who has many daughters, becomes a rich
man by the presents which he receives for each on their marriage. If
a young man wishes to marry, and is possessed of nothing, it often
occurs that he makes a voyage of a year's duration among the other
islands, and making known his purpose demands contributions from those
he visits, to enable him to make up the instalment of goods which it
is necessary to place in the hands of the parents. The ceremony of
betrothing is celebrated by a feast, at which arrack forms a very
necessary adjunct.

It is not lawful for a man to enter the house of a neighbour during his
absence, and if any one offends in this particular he is obliged to pay
a piece of cloth, or some other goods, to the owner of the house. The
sentence is passed by the elders, who openly call upon the offender
to pay the fine, which makes him so ashamed, that he either does so
immediately or leaves the village. This fine is called "_Pakul Dende_"
by the natives. Should any one even touch the wife of another, he must
make a large atonement for the offence. The Macassar traders informed
me, that they were always obliged to watch their people narrowly, to
keep them from approaching too near to the married women, as the least
touch would render them liable to a fine, and unless this was paid the
Arafuras would not be satisfied.

They pride themselves much in the possession of a number of elephants'
tusks, and brass gongs; the value of the first being determined
according to their length, and of the latter by their weight and
circumference. They formerly obtained these articles from the Banda
traders, who themselves procured them from Batavia; but now they are
brought by the Macassars from Batavia, Malacca and Singapore.[24]
These articles do not form for them a necessary article of life, but
are put to a more worthy use, which one would scarcely expect to find
among such uncivilized people. They have a very excusable ambition to
gain the name of rich men, by paying the debts of their poorer fellow
villagers. The officer, whom I quoted above, related to me a very
striking instance of this. At Affara he was present at the election of
the village chiefs, two individuals aspiring to the station of Orang
Tua. The people chose the elder of the two, which greatly afflicted
the other, but he soon afterwards expressed himself satisfied with
the choice the people had made, and said to M. Bik, who had been sent
there on a commission, "What reason have I to grieve; whether I am
Orang Tua or not, I still have it in my power to assist my fellow
villagers." Several old men agreed to this, apparently to comfort him.
Thus the only use they make of their riches is to employ it in settling
differences, and as this is essentially necessary in an Orang Tua, none
but wealthy villagers can aspire to the office.

The following occurrence gives a remarkable proof of the mildness
of their laws. An Arafura, who had gone out fishing, intending to
be absent eight days, did not return, and his wife, who had no
more provisions at home than would last for this period, requested
assistance from her neighbour. Hence arose a mutual friendship, which,
however, at first only shewed itself in little attentions, the man
drawing water, cutting wood, and providing fish for his fair neighbour,
who could not avoid feeling grateful for the kindness; and no one will
be surprised at their friendship at length ripening into love, when,
conscious of their guilt, they took flight to one of the neighbouring
islands. The husband, who had been detained by contrary winds, returned
at the end of two months, and demanded his wife of her brothers, who
were therefore necessitated to go in search of her, when the guilty
couple were soon discovered and brought back to their village. The
injured husband demanded an enormous fine from the seducer of his wife,
which the latter refused to pay, stating that during his entire life
he should not be able to collect a sufficient quantity of trepang to
make up the sum. An appeal was therefore made to the elders, and on
the woman being questioned, she frankly stated the kindness of her
neighbour in supplying her wants had called forth her gratitude, and
this ripened into love--she had made the first advances. The elders
considered this mode of proceeding on the part of the wife rather
strange, and taking it into consideration that it was very difficult
for any one to withstand a declaration of love from a young woman, they
lost sight of the severe laws respecting the conduct of men towards
married women, and determined that the offender should only pay a small
fine, and advised the husband never again to leave his wife at home
without provisions. The lady returned home with her husband, who was
wise enough never to mention the subject, following up the old proverb--

"Men moet geene aude
Koeijen uit de sloot halen."

Among the Arafuras the treatment of their dead betrays, in the greatest
degree, their uncivilized condition, and the uncertainty which exists
among them as to their future state.[25] When a man dies all his
relations assemble and destroy all the goods he may have collected
during his life, even the gongs are broken to pieces and thrown
away. In their villages I met with several heaps of porcelain plates
and basins,[26] the property of deceased individuals, the survivors
entertaining an idea that they have no right to make use of them.

After death the body is laid out on a small mat, and supported against
a ladder until the relatives of the deceased assemble, which seldom
takes place until four days have elapsed; and as decomposition will
have commenced before this, the parts where moisture has appeared are
covered with lime. Fruitless endeavours to stop the progress of decay!
In the meantime damar or resin is continually burnt in the house, while
the guests who have already assembled regale themselves with quantities
of arrack, and of a spirit they themselves prepare from the juice of a
fruit, amid violent raving, the discord being increased by the beating
of gongs and the howling and lamentation of the women. Food is offered
to the deceased, and when they find that he does not partake of it, the
mouth is filled with eatables, siri and arrack, until it runs down the
body, and spreads over the floor.

When the friends and relatives are all collected the body is placed
upon a bier, on which had been laid numerous pieces of cloth, the
quantity being according to the ability of the deceased; and under
the bier are placed large dishes of China porcelain, to catch any
moisture that may fall from the body. The dishes which have been put
to this purpose are afterwards much prized, and it is for this reason
that dishes of an enormous size are so much prized by the Arafuras. A
portion of the moisture that has exuded, is mixed with arrack and drunk
by the guests, who think that they thus show the true affection they
bore to the deceased. During two or three days the house of the dead is
constantly full of drunken and raving guests.

The body is then brought out before the house, and supported against a
post, when attempts are again made to induce it to eat. Lighted segars,
arrack, rice, fruit, &c., are again stuffed into its mouth, and the
by-standers, striking up a song, demand whether the sight of all his
friends and fellow villagers will not induce the deceased to awaken?
At length, when they find all these endeavours to be fruitless, they
place the body on a bier adorned with flags, and carry it out into the
forest, where it is fixed upon the top of four posts. A tree, usually
the _Pavetta Indica_, is then planted near it; and it is remarkable
that at this last ceremony none but women, entirely naked, are present.
This last ceremony is called by the Arafuras "_Sudah Buang_,"[27] by
which they mean that the body is now cast away, and can listen to them
no longer. The entire ceremony proves, that the Arafuras are deprived
of that consolation afforded by our religion; and that they only give
expression to the grief they naturally feel at parting from one to whom
they have been attached.

The children, almost from their birth, are fed with boiled labu or
pumpkin, which renders it easy to wean them at a very early period.
On the birth of a child, a cocoa-nut, with some fish, rice and sago
are hung up under the house, and permitted to drop off when they have
decayed. They informed me that this was intended to prevent the child
from ever being in want of anything during his after life.

Those who know how to read the human heart will, perhaps, find in
the character of these remote and untutored people many points of
interest; and I therefore trust that my reader will pardon this little
digression. I will now proceed with a further description of the Arru
Islands.

brought thither from Siam and Cochin China. The brass gongs are the

CHAPTER XI.

THE ARRU ISLANDS.

Trade of the Arru Islands.--Chief Productions.--Trepang.--The
Island Vorkay.--The Pearl Fishery.--The Arafuras of Kobroor and
Kobiwatu.--Duryella, the capital of Wama.--The Schoolmaster.--Homage
paid by the Natives to M. Kam.

For many years since the inhabitants of the Arru Islands have been
uncontrolled by Europeans, and have been without Christian instructors,
so that they have advanced but little in civilization. They have also
been considerable sufferers from not having the protection of the Dutch
authorities, as the Bughis and Macassars, who come here to trade, are
great extortioners, and appeared more in the light of plunderers than
of friendly traders; which, indeed, is the case with all the people
of India when they are the strongest, and are not controlled by our
Government.

The Arru Islands have, however, always been much visited by native
merchants, chiefly on account of the trepang, tortoise-shell, edible
birds'-nests and pearls which they afford. It will be useful here to
give rather a full account of the first of these products, since it is
from this that the natives derive the greater part of their riches.

The trepang, which is a species of _holothurie_, is found chiefly on
banks composed of clay mixed with fine sand, and covered with slimy
sea-weed, which, at low water, appears above the surface of the sea.
Those engaged in the trade are acquainted with no less than twenty
different sorts, besides which there are several others which are not
eatable, having a very bitter taste. The different sorts are arranged
in the following order:--

1. _Trepang Passir_, or sand trepang, which is found on banks composed
   chiefly of sand, is considered the best, being much in demand at
   Kouding, Aring, and Macassar. The price it usually fetches is one
   hundred and sixty guilders the picul. The different sorts which follow
   decrease in value from this, until the lowest is thirty guilders the
   picul.

2. _Trepang batu._ These have a bluish tinge, and it is necessary to
   cut them through the thickest part, or they cannot be properly dried.

3. _Trepang corro._ This is also cut open, and the entrails removed.

4. _Trepang pandang._

5. _Trepang nanas_, or pine-apple trepang, is covered over with spines
   like the fruit whose name it bears.

6. _Trepang itam_, or black trepang.

7. _Trepang kossong_, white with black speckles.

8. _Trepang buang kulit_, from which it is necessary to strip off two
   thin skins which cover it.

9. _Trepang kay Java._

10. _Trepang Marigi._ This is obtained on the coast of New Holland, and
    is boiled up with the bark of the _kayu bankudu_, which imparts to the
    animal a red colour, and preserves it dry for a long period.

11. _Trepang donga._

12. _Trepang kunyit._

13. _Trepang gama._

14. _Trepang taai konkong._

15. _Trepang bilala._ This is black, and the only species that is flat.

16. _Trepang massee._

17. _Trepang katjang goreng._ This is small, and is also cured with the
    bark of the _kayu bankudu_.

18. _Trepang kuwas._

19. _Trepang puti._ This sort is small, and of a whitish colour.

After the trepang is caught, it is immediately boiled in sea-water,
in which the leaves of the papya are steeped, to take off a thin skin
which covers it. It is then placed in baskets or holes, and covered up
with earth until the following morning, when it is washed repeatedly
to deprive it as much as possible of the disagreeable taste of coral
which it possesses, after which it is spread out on mats, and dried.
Even then it is not entirely free from the unpleasant flavour which is
peculiar to all holothuries or polypes, for which reason the Chinese,
before making it up into soups or ragouts, boil it with sugar-cane.

The Arafuras sell the trepang to the Bughis and others by the ukur, a
measure containing about half a picul. The traders sort the trepang,
there being a great difference in the value of the various kinds. The
price of the first sort in China is one hundred and twenty Spanish
dollars the picul, while the various sorts mixed together can be
purchased at the back of the islands, as the eastern parts are called,
at the rate of ten to fifteen Spanish dollars the picul. The number
of the traders, who now visit the Arrus, has caused the price of
this article to increase considerably above that which was formerly
given. When the people of Banda had the trade exclusively in their
hands, a picul of trepang might be obtained for a sarong, or piece
of cloth of the value of eight guilders, and twenty birdsnests for a
chopping-knife; while now the latter, which will weigh less than a
kati, or 1-1/4lb., cannot be purchased for less than from fourteen to
eighteen guilders. These articles would, however, still yield a large
profit were it not necessary to remain among the Arrus for a period of
four months to collect a cargo of any importance. On this account small
brigs and paduakans only are employed in the trade, as their expense is
less than that of larger vessels.

Vorkay, an island lying exposed to the ocean at the south-eastern
extremity of the group, is of great importance from its pearl fishery.
At a distance of eight miles to the eastward lay several small islands,
between which and Vorkay the trepang banks are situated. At low water
hundreds of men, with their wives and children, may be perceived
wading from Vorkay towards these islets, (the water being only two or
three feet deep,) carrying a basket at their backs, and having in their
hands a stick provided with an iron point. When the water is deeper
than this, they make use of canoes. For fishing on the banks situated
at a greater distance, the Arafuras use a prahu, constructed for the
purpose, in which they embark their entire family. These vessels have a
very strange appearance. They have great beams, and the stern runs up
into a high curve, while two planks project forward from the bows. The
family resides in three or four huts, composed of atap or palm leaves,
erected within the vessel, and a railing runs entirely round it,
apparently to prevent the children from falling overboard. The prahu is
propelled by a large sail made of rushes, which folds up like a fan,
(in a similar manner to the sails of the Chinese junks), set upon a
tripod mast of bamboos, while it is steered by two rudders. Two other
masts are also erected, which answer no purpose but that of displaying
several small flags.

As I have already stated, it is almost impossible for a large ship to
approach the eastern side of the Arrus, as in all parts banks and reefs
stretch far out to sea. There are, however, a few small openings,
through which a brig may enter; but it is absolutely necessary to have
an Arafura pilot on board.

Among the chief villages on Vorkay, are Old and New Affara, Longa, Uri
and Goor, before the last of which lies a great pearl bank. The natives
informed me that it was exhausted, and that they had not fished it
for two years; but this was probably a mis-statement, which they were
induced to make owing to the difficulties attending the fishery. They
said that they only obtained from it large mother-of-pearl shells for
the Chinese market, and that they did not find pearls inside them. The
true pearl oyster is small, with a thin shell.

The pearl fishery is carried on in the following manner. The trader
makes an agreement with the Arafuras for so much a hundred, paying an
advance of a certain quantity of arrack, cloth, &c. When the price
is agreed on the fisher goes to the bank, and dives for the oysters,
which are mostly small and black, in from twenty-four to thirty feet
water, selecting the best he can find. The diving is attended with
much difficulty and danger, as, from the time he remains under water,
the blood often bursts from the nose and mouth of the diver, while he
is also liable to be destroyed by the numerous sharks which are to be
found there.

The chiefs informed me, that in the time of the (Dutch) East India
Company, the pearl fishery was carried on by their order;[28] but when
the Arafuras found themselves becoming more and more independent of the
Christians, and the chiefs were no longer incited by our Government
to carry it on, it was very naturally discontinued, as the labour
attending it is much greater than that of the trepang fishery. Small
quantities of pearls are still obtained in shallow water for the Bughis
traders, but these are of little value, and are chiefly disposed of to
the Chinese, who use them as an ingredient in some of their medicines.

On one occasion we met with a prahu from the Kabroor Islands (at
the east side of the Arrus), the people in which were superior in
appearance to the trepang fishers of Vorkay. They had clearer skins
than the latter, and their hair, which was also much finer, was
very neatly dressed, and adorned with beads. Their weapons, and the
ornaments of their prahus, displayed great taste. The strangers, who
called themselves Arafuras of Borassi, had abundance of food with them,
together with several hunting dogs.

During the year previous to my visit, when the Governor-General Baron
Van Der Capellen visited the Moluccas, he sent two schooners of war,
the _Daphne_ and _Pollux_ to the Arrus, to enquire into the condition
of the people. The arrival of M. A.J. Bik, who was at the head of
this expedition, had given rise to a hope among the natives that the
Government would take an interest in their affairs, so that my visit
naturally excited much joy among them. They welcomed us in the most
friendly manner, kissed our hands, and expressed the greatest joy when
I informed them of the object of my visit, and of the purpose of our
Government to take them again under their protection. The frank and
kind manner in which men and women, heathens as well as Christians,
came forth to meet us, was truly striking and impressive, the more from
these innocent people being, unlike many others of the Indian races,
entirely free from dissimulation. Even the children crowded around to
kiss us.

On the afternoon of my arrival I went on shore accompanied by M. Kam
and several other gentlemen, to the village of Wanla, which is erected
on a point of limestone rock, about thirty feet above the level of the
sea. It contains only ten or twelve poor and small houses; but the
stone church, which also overhangs the sea, was in very good condition.
Wanla is a dependence of Duryella, the capital of Wama, but is under
the immediate control of an Orang Tua.

In several places we saw prahus hauled up on the beach, which are hired
to the traders during the time they remain among the islands. In the
interior we saw a number of sago trees, the pith of which constituted
the chief food of the natives. The ground, generally, is by no means
fertile, and in many parts is overgrown with underwood, there being but
few spots calculated for the cultivation of rice.

On Sunday, the 28th of August, I set out for Duryella, our road, which
lay along the beach, being almost impassable from the number of trees
which had been thrown up by the sea during the westerly monsoon. If the
inhabitants were rather more industrious they would cut a road through
the beautiful forest which runs down close to the sea. Among the trees
which lined the shore I recognized the _kanari_, the _katapan laut_,
the _tutun_, the _yamplon_,[29] the _casuarina_, and the _bua-raja_,
the last of which bears much resemblance to the Javanese fern or
_pohon paku_, the leaves having a beautiful green colour; the fruit,
when dried and pounded fine, is often used instead of flour in the
composition of pastry.

After an hour's walking we arrived at Duryella, where we were received
with much solemnity under a salute of _lelahs_. The village, which is
well built and kept in very good order, forms nearly a square. On the
beach opposite, a stage was erected on a high tree, on which several
_lelahs_ were mounted; this was formerly used for their protection,
when the inhabitants were at war with the people of Wadia; but since
peace had been made between them by M. Bik, the fortification had been
allowed to fall into disrepair.

The house of the Orang Kaya, Jacob Barend, in which we were received,
answered also for a fort. It was erected on high piles of iron-wood,
and consisted of several rooms, in which the numerous family of the
Orang Kaya took up their residence. The remainder of the houses,
which formed the village, were smaller, but constructed after the
same manner; and the neat little church was kept in good order. The
schoolmaster, who resided here, appeared to do his best in instructing
his fellow Christians. These teachers, who also perform divine service,
are usually young natives of Amboyna, who, after having undergone a
course of instruction, are sent among the neighbouring islands without
salaries, and being therefore dependent on the natives for support,
they are sometimes, from want of the protection of the Government,
in very necessitous circumstances. The hope of being relieved and
settled at Amboyna, after having been employed as missionaries a few
years, renders them very willing to undertake this office, which would
otherwise be a truly great sacrifice on their part, as none can feel
greater reluctance to leave their homes for a long period than the
inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago in general.

M. Bik, on fixing two Amboynese teachers here, whom he brought with
him, promised them a salary, and also to supply them now and then
with necessaries, as occasion might offer. I therefore considered it
my duty to advance them some money and clothes, while at the same time
I suggested to the inhabitants that they ought regularly to contribute
something to the support of these useful men. The teachers pride
themselves on their descent as Amboynese, and are uncommonly neat
in their dress. I never saw one otherwise than well clad, wearing a
three-cornered hat, a black coat of cloth or cotton, small-clothes of
the same materials, with shoes, and black silk or cotton stockings.
The teacher at Wokan was married to the daughter of the Orang Kaya,
and was as much respected as he was esteemed. Their usual employment
consists in instructing the children in reading and writing the Malay
language (Roman letters, not the Arabic characters, being used), and in
initiating them in the rudiments of the Reformed Religion. They rarely,
however, acquire a full insight into the last, as the young people
are forced to leave school at an early period, that they may assist
their parents in their avocations. He also performs divine service
every Sunday, during which he reads passages from the Bible, and the
community under his direction sing psalms in the Malayan tongue,[30]
the service being usually closed with a discourse on the precepts and
duties of Christianity.

We tarried a considerable time at the residence of the Orang Kaya,
where a number of people had assembled, among whom were the chiefs of
the neighbouring villages, who had come to welcome us and pay their
respects. This afforded me a good opportunity of breaking to them
the object of my visit; and as I wished to make as much impression
on their minds as possible, I arranged that a general meeting should
be held on Wokan on the 29th of August, when the business might be
entered into more fully. M. Kam, also, to the great satisfaction of the
Christians, held a long communication with them on religious subjects,
and about fifty of the natives were baptized on the occasion. After
this ceremony had been completed, amid the greatest attention and
propriety of conduct, we amused ourselves in examining the gardens in
the vicinity, the people appearing to be much pleased at our visiting
their dwellings.

Early on the following morning I despatched two of the boats, with a
portion of my party, to Wokan, and at eight o'clock, by which time a
large number of prahus had collected around the brig, I also departed
in a third boat, accompanied by M. Dielwaart, under a salute from our
guns. The large number of prahus, with which the chiefs accompanied
us, presented a very imposing appearance. As we approached Wokan, a
salvo was fired from a one-pounder gun, which we had in the boat,
and on stepping ashore we were received with military honours by
the twenty-eight armed European seamen who had preceded us, which,
doubtless, made a proper impression on the Orang Kayas who awaited us
on the beach.

We now proceeded to the fort, from which shots were occasionally fired,
while the people welcomed us with loud shouts of joy. Especial homage
was paid to M. Kam, who subsequently arrived from Wama, as soon as
he had stepped on shore; the schoolmaster, and a number of young men
and women assembled around him, and commenced the twenty-fifth psalm,
singing which they accompanied him until he arrived among us. They
then placed themselves respectfully behind the clergyman, and after
the psalm was finished they rested awhile, and prepared to commence
another; but as I wished to finish my affairs as soon as possible,
and at the same time was desirous of avoiding giving offence to the
Mohammedan chiefs who were present, I requested them to defer it to
another occasion. The Christian inhabitants of these parts take great
delight in singing psalms, and they practice much: they know many of
them by heart. Their respect for the Bible is also very great, and they
preserve the portions of scriptures, which they formerly received, with
as much care as if they were costly jewels. This betokens a strong
inclination and capacity on their part to increase their acquaintance
with our religion, and this trait in their character may, with a little
attention, be made a powerful instrument in improving their condition.

CHAPTER XII.

THE ARRU ISLANDS.

Gathering of the People at Wokan.--Religious Exercises of
the People.--Their singular Mode of Dress.--The Church.--The
Fort.--State of Christianity on Wokan.--Dobbo, an important Trading
Place.--Commercial Advantages that may be gained there.--Valuable
Fishery.--The Pilandok.--Ludicrous alarm of the Arafuras.

On the following morning I informed the assembled chiefs of Wokan
of the object of my mission to those parts, namely, to take the
inhabitants under the protection of the Dutch Government; to renew the
mutual friendship which formerly existed between them;[31] to incite
them to carry on more trade, especially with Banda and Amboyna; to
confirm the chiefs in their authority; and to promote the welfare and
prosperity of these islands and their inhabitants.

After the meeting had been broken up, our party, together with the
chiefs of the villages, were invited to dinner by the daughters of the
Upper Orang Kaya. The table was spread with a number of well cooked
dishes. The wine which I had brought for the entertainment of the
chiefs, with the arrack for those of lesser rank, added not a little
to the festivity. I remarked on this occasion, that three Orang Kayas,
after having drunk a tolerable quantum of wine, finished a bottle
of arrack without either of them showing any signs of inebriety. An
unsparing use of spirituous liquors may be considered as the greatest
vice of the inhabitants of the Arrus, both Christians and Arafuras.
The traders bring here large quantities of arrack, together with an
inferior kind of aniseed, on which they obtain a very large profit. The
natives themselves distil a spirit from sago and rice.

After dinner the people were busily employed in arraying themselves
in their best clothes, to attend divine service. Coats and breeches,
probably the manufacture of the previous century, were brought to
light out of their chests, and from the smoke of their fires, where
they had been hung up to preserve them from insects. Among the presents
given to the chiefs by M. Bik the previous year, were several pieces
of black cloth, which the former had made up with their own hands
into coats, &c., after the model of the old-fashioned smoked clothes
above-mentioned, using coarse white thread in the construction. The
remnants of the cloth had been made up into head-dresses in the form of
night-caps. I set the ship's tailor to work altering their coats, to
the no small delight of the chiefs.

The church, situated on the south side of the village, is a handsome
and strong stone building, and although the doors and windows are
wanting, it is otherwise kept carefully in order. On each side of the
entrance are benches and reading desks for the men, while a number of
old-fashioned carved chairs, certainly a century and a half old, were
placed in the centre for the women. Here and there gravestones might
be perceived, the inscriptions on which had become illegible. Their
dead are not now interred in or near the church, but are deposited in
an enclosed cemetery, some distance to the north-east of the fort. The
tomb-stones here are ornamented in different ways, and it is a strong
proof of the good disposition of these people, that the tombs of the
officers of the late East India Company, who have died here, are kept
in as good order as those of their own chiefs and forefathers.

Early on the following morning, the 30th of August, I was requested by
the natives to allow M. Kam to hold another religious meeting on this
day, that a number more of them might have an opportunity of being
married and christened. I willingly gave my consent, and promised to be
present with my European fellow-voyagers.

On the previous day I had remarked, that the pulpit was ornamented by
a curtain formed of a piece of silk. By way of giving the congregation
an agreeable surprise, I caused the teacher to suspend in its place a
large covering of fine silk, ornamented with the arms of the King of
the Netherlands. The sight of this, on their entering the church, had
a great effect on the people, who loudly expressed their thanks for
this attention; so that I became convinced that this present of the
Government could not have been put to a better use.

During the morning several of the seamen asked my permission to attend
the church, that they might become baptismal witnesses to some
of the natives who had requested their services; this I willingly
allowed, cautioning them however to maintain the strictest propriety
of conduct. On entering the church, where a large congregation was
assembled, we found chairs and benches prepared for our accommodation.
The Upper Orang Kaya and his wife requested me to stand godfather to
their daughter, who was to be christened Diderika Hendrika; indeed,
nearly all the congregation underwent this ceremony, even people who
had attained the age of forty years. Among those who were united in
matrimony, were many couples who had already lived, for a long period,
in a state of wedlock; in fact, several cases occurred in which parents
and children were married at the same time. On only one occasion was
there any confusion, and this was caused by a ludicrous accident
happening to the dress of a young bridegroom, who had arrayed himself
for the ceremony in some old, worn-out, and smoke-dried clothes,
which, above all, were too small for him. This was too much for any
gravity to endure, and the young ladies especially could not restrain
their merriment; but a friendly hand tendered the unlucky youth a
sarong, in which he would gladly have enveloped himself entirely
to conceal his confusion. To add to the solemnity of the occasion,
several German flutes had been brought to accompany the psalms, the
natives, especially the women, being extremely fond of the music of
this instrument. At the request of M. Kam, my Amboynese piper attended
to play second; but although the poor youth did all he could with hands
and feet, he was unable to keep in tune, so that we were soon obliged
to put a stop to the _disconcerto_.

The ceremony was extremely long, but the attention shown by the
audience was truly exemplary; indeed, in the mother country I have
seen a congregation asleep from weariness at a much shorter service,
so that in this respect our countrymen and countrywomen may learn an
example from the simple inhabitants of the Arru Islands. Even after
the service they assembled at the house of the teacher, and sang
several more psalms; the newly married couples being also ceremoniously
congratulated on the joyful occasion. While they were thus employed, I
took the opportunity of paying a visit to the ruins of the fort.

This fort, which is now in state of great dilapidation--patches of
a wall, which was once three feet thick and twenty feet high, alone
remaining--formed a square, with bastions at the corners; but of the
latter nothing was now visible, some posts having been erected in their
place, on which several _lelahs_ were mounted. The house of the Orang
Kaya, which stands in the centre, is the only part in good repair. The
natives were very desirous of having a Dutch garrison again among them,
in which case they would willingly set to work and put the fort into
complete order.

Several of the Mohammedans, who had been driven out of the village,
formerly resided a little to the northward; but these have now put
themselves under the rule of the Christians, with whom they live on
good terms.

I passed the afternoon in settling the affairs of the natives, the
chiefs of the neighbouring villages being present. Bernard Herman was
appointed as Upper Orang Kaya, with the promise of a golden-knobbed
baton. The chiefs of Wadia betrayed considerable jealousy, and
requested me to do them the same honour I had conferred on the people
of Wokan; I therefore promised that I would visit their head village
with the brig, at which they appeared to be well contented, and
departed for their homes to make ready for our reception. Among the
Government presents which I gave to the Orang Kaya were two Dutch
flags, on which they set a high value; in addition to which I left in
his hands some trifles for the Arafuras of the islands at the back of
the group.

At the conclusion of these ceremonies I sent both boats on board the
brig, the remainder of our party intending to stop the night at the
house of the Orang Kaya. During our stay the seamen occupied a house
which had been prepared for their reception, where they were abundantly
supplied with provisions.

To the northward of the chief village of Wokan there are several
small villages, the most important of which, Samau, is inhabited by
Mohammedans, who are under the control of the people of the capital.
The chiefs of the western islands extend their authority over the
Arafuras, each chief having several villages under his rule, the
inhabitants of which paid a willing obedience to their governors
while they were supported by our Government, who, for this purpose,
had only about ten European or Amboynese soldiers on the islands, the
serjeant of the party being the commanding officer. The Arafuras then
considered themselves obliged to give an account of all their actions
to the Christian chiefs, to whom they also delivered up a portion
of the profits of their trade. These heathens, in general, are much
desirous of becoming converts to Christianity, and willingly allow
their children to be instructed in its tenets; but for many years since
there have been no teachers, much less missionaries or clergymen among
them. Our religion has therefore retrograded, while Islamism, of which
there are many priests here, has advanced considerably. This is much to
be regretted; for, as I have already stated, a similarity in religious
belief forms our strongest bond of union with the people of these
countries. The Arafuras prefer Christianity to Mohammedanism, so that
were proper measures taken much might be done, especially as they are
better in their disposition than the heathen inhabitants of the islands
we had previously visited.

Leaving Wokan on the 31st, I next visited Dobbo, a village situated on
a spit of sand five hundred yards long, extending from the north-east
side of Wama, and reducing the channel between the latter island
and Wokan to about a mile. This spit affords shelter to the trading
vessels, which anchor to the eastward or to the westward of it,
according to the monsoon, and fourteen or fifteen sheds are erected
upon it, under which they can be hauled up and repaired. It is very
difficult to enter the harbour without a pilot, as steep reefs, dry at
low water, extend a considerable distance from Wama and Wokan, forming
a narrow and crooked channel, with a depth of eight, nine, and ten
fathoms. The reefs, which are always visible in fine weather, extend
farther from Wokan than from Wama, so that the channel lies nearest to
the south shore. In the early part of the west monsoon several brigs
from Sourabaya (Java), a number of paduakans from Macassar (Celebes),
together with many other vessels from different places, among which are
many small craft from the Ki Islands and Goram, visit this harbour, the
greater part of which are hauled up on the beach during their stay, and
covered over with sheds of _atap_. The traders, with the assistance of
the natives, erect houses wherein they reside and deposit their goods,
the guns belonging to their vessel being planted around it. The traders
remain here until the month of June, Dobbo, during their stay, having
the appearance of a very populous place. The traders, immediately on
their arrival, hire vessels from the inhabitants, which they send with
a portion of their crew to the more distant islands, to purchase
trepang, edible birds'-nests, and mother-of-pearl shell. The trade is
conducted with great regularity, and if differences now and then occur,
they are always put an end to by the mediation of the Orang Kaya. The
commanders of the trading vessels pay a certain quantity of arrack
and cloth as anchorage dues and ground rent, and although the amount
paid by each is small, the number of traders is so great as to render
this an important source of income to the inhabitants. Soon after the
departure of the traders Dobbo is abandoned for the season, the old
houses being burnt by the natives that they may have to build new ones
the following year, and thus increase their gains.

This spit offers a good situation for the erection of a small fort, the
wells upon it supplying good fresh water, while the high beach is open
on both sides to the sea-breeze. According to the universal testimony
of the natives, this spot is very healthy, and although the sea is
disturbed by the number of vessels, it affords abundance of fish. A
party sent here from the brig to fish with the seine, obtained at three
hauls, a sufficient quantity of kakap (a sort of cod), and other
delicate fish, to half fill the boat.

As nothing is to be feared from the natives, I feel convinced that
were a fort to be erected on this spot it would soon become a very
prosperous trading place. At present the natives do not settle here
in great numbers, as the foreign traders do not like them to reside
among them. As soon as the traders have departed the people give
themselves up to idleness, and only commence collecting produce a
short time previous to their return. Neither do the foreign traders
now like to settle on the islands, perhaps because they do not place
much confidence in the people. I am convinced, however, that were a
representative of the Dutch Government to reside here, it would soon
become a highly prosperous place, and the harbour would never be
without vessels in it.

I cannot avoid giving a short description of the Pilandok or Arru
rabbits, an animal rather larger than the common rabbit, of a grey
colour, which, as they grow old, becomes quite grizzly. The forelegs
are short, and the hind ones, which resemble those of the hare, have
each three toes, provided with strong nails. The head is like that
of a weazel. These animals do not run very fast, and when resting
they usually sit upright on their hind legs. Their food consists of
the leaves of the yam plant and other greens, and they are easily
tamed, when they may be suffered to run around the house without their
attempting to escape. The flavour of their flesh is very agreeable.

On the 1st of September, when at Duryella, I appointed the Orang
Kayas to the islands of Wama and Maykor, to each of whom I presented
a silver-knobbed baton, besides other government gifts, as pieces of
cloth, flags, &c. Several of the chiefs of the more distant islands
were also confirmed in their authority on the same occasion, many other
affairs being also settled; among which was a reconciliation between
the people of two villages on Vorkay, who for some time previously had
lived in state of war with each other. The quarrel originated in one of
the parties fishing too long on a reef which was their mutual property,
and thus obtaining too large a share of its produce. It had already
been provisionally adjusted through the mediation of the Christian
chiefs, and was now submitted to me for my final decision. The
offenders solemnly promised that they would not hereafter exceed their
right, and the affair was settled to the satisfaction of both parties,
who declared that they would henceforward live in peace and friendship
with each other.

The greater portion of the Christian inhabitants of Maykor had come
to Duryella, partly to attend to their own interests, and partly for
the purpose of being present at the preachings of M. Kam, on which
occasions a large number of people were admitted as members of the
Christian Church. I occasionally invited the chiefs to dinner with
me, which was always considered by them as a great honour, and they
never failed to come attended by a numerous retinue, Arafuras as well
as Christians, who crept on board from all sides in an instant. The
chiefs of the more distant islands, not having been informed of my
arrival, had come in their usual dress, the tdejako, or waist-cloth, as
they never adorn themselves with their best clothing except on festive
occasions. These chiefs were much ashamed of their _deshabille_, and
made repeated excuses; but being informed of the cause, I rejoiced them
by having _kabayas_ and breeches prepared for them, when they made
their appearance with much greater confidence.

On one occasion a number of chiefs, who had dined on board, remained
to spend the evening with me, many of whom, particularly the Arafuras,
declared to me that they had never before been on board a ship of war.
To give them a good idea of such a vessel I ordered several of the
great guns to be fired, and although we had informed them of what was
coming, they were terribly frightened, and it was truly ridiculous to
see them jump into the air at every shot, like harlequins. Many of
them, indeed, jumped overboard, while others hid themselves under the
table which stood on the deck, and in any corner they could find. These
islanders generally can carry off an inconceivable quantity of spirits.
Although at our festive meetings on board more than thirty jugs of
arrack were often drunk, they would still take a quantity on shore with
them to finish the evening at home.

The prahus which are built upon these islands are very long, and sit
low on the water, their length being seldom less than seventy feet,
while their greatest breadth is not greater than ten feet. We saw about
thirty of these lying under the shore, and had good opportunities for
examining them. In the centre of them is a stage, on which they make a
fire to cook their provisions. Whenever these vessels sail on a voyage
they are adorned with a number of flags, some being displayed from the
stern and others planted along the sides, the whole presenting a very
gay appearance. These flags are triangular (perhaps in imitation of
those of the Chinese), and of various colours, the prahus belonging to
the chiefs being distinguished by the superior size and number of those
they display. The inhabitants of the western Arrus obtain their prahus
chiefly from the Ki Islands, these being stronger and broader than
those constructed by the people of the Eastern Arrus. The Arafuras,
when at sea, protect themselves from the rain, which they dislike
greatly, by means of long bags open on one side, made from the bark of
a tree. When the weather is fine, they roll these up and use them as a
cushion to sit upon.

The abolition of the slave trade has not yet spread its beneficent
influence to these parts; indeed, the export and import of slaves forms
a considerable branch of commerce, &c.: so much so, that were it to
be discontinued many of the inhabitants would become a prey to want.
It must here be taken into consideration, that the words "slave" and
"slave trade" have a very different signification here from that which
they have in the West Indies, the people of the east regarding the
slave trade as being, in a certain point of view, beneficial to the
slaves themselves. Many, in fact, when in distress, offer themselves
as bondsmen that they may obtain the necessaries of life. The natives,
however, are well aware that this shameful trade is much disapproved
of by our Government, and that the greatest object of their rule is to
secure general freedom and prosperity to mankind, for which reason the
slaveholders treat their people with humanity. These creatures are,
therefore, less to be pitied than one would suppose; and it must be
taken into consideration, that so long as agriculture and industry are
so much neglected, the slave trade must be a source of subsistence to
a great part of these islanders, by means of which they are held back
from engaging in piracy, theft, and other vices, to which want and
necessity would otherwise force them to resort.[32]

When M. Bik was here he was presented with two slave boys, to whom,
as I was informed by the natives, he gave their liberty, and caused
them to be sent back to their village. Shortly after the departure
of this gentleman these liberated slaves fell into a state of great
poverty, so that, to pay the debts they had incurred for provisions and
necessaries, they had again pledged or sold themselves as slaves, and
they now regard themselves as fortunate in having found a good master.
On my asking them if they wished to become free again? they answered,
that they would like it well if I would take them with me, and provide
for their future maintenance, but that otherwise they would prefer
living in their present state of servitude. I allowed my interpreter
to redeem a couple of orphans who had been sold here by the Arafuras,
and did not seem to have derived much good from their master, for which
he paid eighty guilders. At their own request I took them with me to
Amboyna, where, with the cognizance of the Government, I set them at
liberty, so that they became in a condition to gain their livelihood by
daily labour.[33]

On the 4th of September the chiefs of Maykor and Wama came to take
their leave, and to present us with some stock and fruit, after which
we weighed anchor and steered for the island Wadia. A number of prahus
accompanied us a considerable distance, the natives in them displaying
their friendship by the music of their gongs and songs of joy.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 31: So early as 1640, F. Corsten entered into a treaty with
the people of the Arrus, especially those of Wokan, Wadia, Wama,
Duryella and Maykor, in which the latter agreed to acknowledge the
supremacy of the Dutch East India Company. Afterwards, in 1645, the
Fiscal Dorstman obtained from them an agreement to trade exclusively
with Banda, while the monopoly of the pearl fishery was given to the
East India Company.]

[Footnote 32: M. Kolff, whose opinion upon this point is totally at
variance with that of Sir Stamford Raffles, and of every other writer
on the Indian Archipelago, who has really taken an interest in the
welfare of the natives, appears to have mistaken effect for cause;
as in this part of the world it has invariably been found that the
slave trade alone has been sufficient to render a people, previously
mild and industrious, poor, idle and vicious. As to the slave trade
preventing the natives from engaging in piracy, M. Kolff _must_ have
been aware that by far the greater number of piratical expeditions
fitted out by the natives are intended solely for the capture of
slaves, other plunder being in their eyes of minor importance only; and
this is especially the case in the parts visited by M. Kolff, where the
inhabitants possess nothing of sufficient value to tempt the cupidity
of pirates.--_Ed._]

glad to obtain Dutch gold and silver coin, the greater part of which
they work up into ear-rings and other ornaments.]

and its Inhabitants.--Dispute between them and the Orang Tua of
Fannabel.--Sad Result of their Contentions.--Departure from the Arru
Islands.--Arrival at the Tenimber Group.--Vordate.--Ignorance and

We soon entered the narrow strait which separates the islands of Wassia
and Wadia, the last of which was the object of our visit. The people
of Wakan, Samau, and the other villages on the sea shore saluting us
with shots from their _lelahs_, which were answered by the brig with
several guns. Wassia, the north-westernmost of the Arrus, is overgrown
with underwood, and the coral reefs extend some distance from it on
all sides, preventing vessels from approaching the shore. The village
of Wadia is situated on the west side of the island of that name, on
the banks of a salt-water creek, several other villages being scattered
over the island.

As soon as we had anchored in the strait, in ten fathoms sand, about
four miles from the village of Wadia, the Orang Tuas of the island came
on board in two prahus, to bid us welcome. My interpreter accompanied
them on shore, to inform the chiefs that I should land the following
day to transact the business which had brought me here. With a view
to add as much solemnity as possible to my visit, I sent twenty-six
armed men on shore early in the morning, and soon after followed them
with the gentlemen attached to the expedition. After entering the
creek we passed a temple and a number of tombs, and soon arrived at
the village, which lies about a cable's length and a half from the
mouth. The houses, which stand separated from each other, are erected
on both sides of the river, but by far the greater number are to be
found on the right-hand side, the dwelling of the Orang Kaya forming a
conspicuous object among them.

On our approach to the river we were saluted with seven shots from a
one-pounder gun, which had been taken on shore from the brig, while our
men were drawn up on the beach to receive us with military honours,
the natives themselves saluting us with numerous shots from their
_lelahs_, and displaying several Dutch flags, which appeared to be of
their own manufacture. The _Orang Kaya_ welcomed us to his house with
many expressions of friendship, when we found that one-half of his
dwelling, (a new and rather large building, similar to that of the
Orang Kaya of Duryella), had been arranged for our reception, another
house having been appropriated for the accommodation of our men. As
the house of the Orang Kaya is usually the place where the chiefs
assemble, we thought it most advisable to take up our quarters in a
small building which had been occupied by the foreign traders, but was
now empty.

The population of Wadia is composed of Mohammedans, so that I did not
perceive among the chiefs the same affection towards the Netherland's
Government which those of the Christian islands displayed. On
conversing with them concerning the non-fulfillment of the promise
they made to M. Bik in 1824, to resort to Banda, I clearly discovered
that the Macassar traders had done all in their power to make them
fearful of us. These had made them believe that the sole object of our
Government consisted in increasing their revenue from imposts, and
many similar absurdities, which it cost me considerable difficulty to
drive from their minds. They also asserted, that owing to the small
amount of the population they dared not leave their villages for a
lengthened period, unless the Netherlands' Government should have a
post upon the Arru Islands.

This request for a Dutch Resident or Postholder, with a small garrison,
was made to me on all the islands, and the people appeared to be well
aware that it would contribute greatly to maintaining order among them,
and increasing their prosperity. Christians, Mahommedans and Arafuras,
all perfectly agreed in this particular.

The creek on which this village is situated, runs right through the
island. Both banks are low and marshy, and the depth of water in it
is very small; indeed, many parts are quite dry at low water. It is
abundantly stocked with fish, which, in fact, is the case everywhere
among the group. Live stock, on the other hand, is very scarce: pigs
are only kept by the Arafuras, the Mohammedans contenting themselves
with goats and fowls, which last are to be purchased at the rate of a
rupee each. With the exception of these there are no tame stock on
the islands. Wild hogs are abundant, but they are rarely hunted by the
natives.

The _pilandok_ is also to be met with, together with birds-of-paradise,
and immense numbers of cockatoos, red, green and black _loories_,
and other sorts of handsomely-plumaged birds. The Arafuras shoot the
birds-of-paradise with arrows, when they are opened, and deprived of
their entrails, and then wrapped in a thin leaf and hung to dry in the
smoke of their fires; this being the only preparation they require to
render them ready for exportation.

Sago and yams form the only vegetable productions which the island
affords. Rice is imported by the Macassars, and by the people of the
Ki and Goram Islands, who, on their part, obtain them from Banda. The
people have but few wants. Their dwellings are mean, and their sole
property consists in slaves, muskets, lelahs, gongs and elephants'
tusks. The first are obtained chiefly from New Guinea, and from the
back parts of the group.

The people of Wadia, and of the western islands of the Arru group
in general, are very desirous of obtaining the imitation blue, red
and black calicoes,[34] especially the last sort manufactured in
the Netherlands. Square checked, or closely flowered chintzes, are
also much in demand. These goods, however, would be too fine for the
Arafuras of the back of the group, who only care for those of coarser
materials, such as coarse chintzes, blue and white _salempoors_, red
coast-calicoes, red baftas, Samanap sarongs, axes, parangs, chopping
knives, brass wire, coarse Chinese porcelain, arrack, aniseed, gongs,
elephants' tusks, small red beads and other trifles of a similar
description.

The inhabitants of the western parts of the group carry on a constant
bartering trade among the group; the long and light vessels previously
described, which are from twelve to sixteen tons burthen, being
employed in transporting the goods from island to island. The period
which elapses between the cessation of one monsoon and the commencement
of the other, is the fittest period for these voyages. They are
fearful, however, of going to Banda or Amboyna, not only from the
reasons already given, but from a dread that the Government would
chastise them for some deeds they had committed. I endeavoured, as much
as lay in my power, to banish this idea from their minds, promising
them forgiveness on the part of the Government; and my exertions were
attended with so much success, that during the following year, while I
was remaining at Amboyna, a greater number of their vessels arrived at
that place, and also at Banda, than had been the case previously.

The inhabitants of the villages on Wadia profess the Mohammedan
religion. In point of numbers they are far inferior to the Christians
of the neighbouring islands, with whom they live on very good terms,
and like them consider themselves as subjects to the Dutch Government,
although they appear to be more restless in their characters than the
others. A difference had long existed between the people of Wadia
and the _Orang Tua_ of Fannabel; and the _Orang Kaya_ of Wokan, with
the minor chiefs of that island, had followed me hither to assist in
inquiring into and deciding the dispute.

After I had made known to the inhabitants the philanthropic and humane
object of our Government, they gave me many proofs of their wishes to
pursue a proper course. I was subsequently petitioned to examine into
and decide the affair of the Orang Tua of Fannabel, which, from the
evidence given by both parties, appeared to be as follows:--

The Orang Tua of Fannabel possessed a stone building, defended by
cannon, on the north-east side of Wokan, and being a skilful trader
he soon increased his property until he became one of the wealthiest
men in the islands. This aroused the envy of the people of Wadia,
of which island the Orang Tua had formerly been an inhabitant. On
the occasion of the marriage of one of his daughters, there arose a
difference between a native of Fannabel and another of Wadia, of so
violent a nature, that each threatened to take the life of the other
on the first opportunity. Some time after this, a number of the people
of Wadia visited Wokan to assist the _Orang Kaya_ in the construction
of a church, and on their return home, one of the parties engaged in
the above-mentioned quarrel, with four others, were murdered in their
prahu. The offenders, who were soon after taken, declared that they had
been paid for committing the deed by the people of Fannabel, on which
those of Wadia, without enquiring farther into the matter, went to the
house of the Orang Tua of Fannabel during his absence, and by way of
taking revenge for the murder, they shot several of his family, took
away the remainder as slaves, and then plundered and burned the house.
The Orang Tua, on his return to his home, seeing the destruction that
had taken place, fled to Wokan, where he was received with hospitality.
The Orang Kaya of that place, however, considering that he was not
sufficiently powerful to obtain redress for his friend by force, and
being also unwilling to go to war with the people of Wadia, commenced
negotiations, by which means a portion of the stolen property was
returned.

This affair had taken place four years previous to my visit. The
ill-treated Orang Tua assured me that he often thought of visiting
Banda to obtain redress through the interposition of the Government,
but had always been withheld by the hope that the latter would again
take possession of the Arru Islands, in which case he would have
brought the case before them, although he was himself aware that it
would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain back all the goods of
which he had been plundered.

At the assembly which had been called together strong debates took
place, which lasted until four o'clock. Some of the arguments put forth
will tend to show their erroneous ideas of right and equity. A man
who had carried off three of the Orang Tua's slaves, was unwilling to
return more than one, or at most two, wishing to keep the remainder to
pay for the maintenance of the whole. I explained to another, that as
there was not the least proof of any offence on the part of the Orang
Tua of Fannabel (they themselves holding him guiltless of the murder
which had been committed,) while he had already suffered severely from
the loss of his son, and of all his goods, it was nothing but just
that he should have every thing possible restored to him. "Here,"
answered he, "are four of our family slain in their prahu; we must
therefore have redress from somebody, no matter whom." At length it was
determined, that a portion of the goods should be restored, and several
gongs, elephants' tusks and slaves were immediately given up.

After I had thus changed the inveterate hatred into friendship, and
had settled some other differences, I appointed a certain Abdul Wahab
as their Orang Kaya, to the universal satisfaction of the people, and
ceremoniously installed him in his office.

During our stay here I examined the neighbourhood of the village, and
met with some former strongholds, the remains of which proved that they
must have been extensive. We also found the traces of a long street,
enclosed by walls, running east and west through the village, together
with the ruins of many stone houses. The natives could give us no clear
information concerning them.

On the 8th of September we made ready for our departure. When our
people were on the point of embarking in the boats, the above-mentioned
Orang Tua of Fannabel came to me to complain that the four slaves had
not yet been given up to him, and that if we departed before this
took place he would never get them back. I therefore caused it to be
announced to the defaulter, that if he did not perform his contract
I would take the slaves from his house by force, on which they were
immediately given up. After having impressed him with a sense of the
injustice and impropriety of conduct he had been guilty of, I caused
my interpreter to draw up, in Arab characters, a solemn agreement
of mutual reconciliation and friendship, which was signed by both
parties, who promised in my presence that they would henceforward live
together in amity.

The Orang Kaya, with all his chiefs, accompanied us on board, and took
a friendly farewell of us, after having received some presents of
coffee and arrack. On the same day we left our anchorage off Wadia,
and stood to the southward under press of sail, towards the Tenimber
Islands.

The day after our departure we sighted the island Vordate to the
south-west. From a distance of about twenty miles on this side, this
island appears alternately hilly and flat, like irregular mountains,
while the neighbouring islands, Larrat, Timor-laut, &c., have a more
level appearance. Several reefs extend a considerable distance to
seaward from the south-east end of the island.

We continued during the night under easy sail, and the following
morning, under the guidance of the pilot, we passed along the west side
of Vordate, at a distance of about six miles from the shore. Off the
north point, a mile to seaward, lies a rock, for which reason the point
must not be made free with. The villages, in which were displayed a
number of small flags, alternating with the fertile valleys, presented
an alluring picture to us. As we passed a number of prahus came rowing
towards us, the people in which called out to us to anchor off their
village. The pilot, however, affirming that there was good anchorage
near Larrat, we continued our course without accepting the invitation
of the islanders. We crossed the extensive reef of Larrat in irregular
depths of three, four and five fathoms, and ran along the north-west
coast towards the mouth of a bay, which is formed between the island of
Larrat and the point of Timor-laut.

On approaching the entrance of the bay, I clearly perceived that there
was no possibility of the brig being able to enter. On perceiving
this, the pilot, as is usual with natives under similar circumstances,
became completely cast down, and all that I could learn from him was
that he had never visited the island before except during the westerly
monsoon, and then only in small vessels which they could row over the
reefs. This was all very true; but had he only given me the slightest
idea of the situation of the bay, I should certainly not have come
here; but it was now necessary to make a virtue of necessity, and come
to a speedy determination. The wind blew directly out of the mouth of
the bay, which was very narrow, so that there was no possibility of
working in. We could obtain no bottom with the deep-sea lead and one
hundred fathoms of line, while we were everywhere surrounded by shoals.
I therefore sent the boats to lie on the edge of the coral reef which
fronts the village of Watidal, and then stood on, hoping that our
anchor might hook a rock and hold fast; but, although the anchor was
let go in four fathoms water, it had dragged into twelve fathoms before
the ship was brought up, while under the stern there was thirty-eight
fathoms. A kedge was then carried out astern, to prevent the tide from
swinging the ship on to the reef.

Before the sails could be furled, or the boarding nettings spread, the
brig was surrounded on all sides by a number of canoes, and I had no
sooner given permission to a couple of natives to come on board, than
the others all followed, so that, in a less space of time than five
minutes, the brig was full of men, who had crept on board through the
ports and every place where they could find admission. With a view to
inspire them with confidence I permitted them to enter, and received
them in as friendly a manner as possible, the distribution of some
glasses of arrack among them contributing not a little to produce the
desired effect.

The village off which we had anchored, like all on these islands, was
erected on a hill of limestone rock, near the sea shore. These villages
present a very picturesque appearance: they consist, according to
their population, of from twenty to fifty houses, erected near each
other, upon piles from six to eight feet high. These dwellings are
from twenty to twenty-five feet long by twelve to fifteen broad. They
are enclosed on all sides, and have a couple of long holes cut in the
walls to serve for windows. The roofs are covered with a thatch of palm
leaves, these being first arranged on small sticks, and then placed
neatly on the roof, overlapping each other. The interior is usually
kept in good order; but every part is blackened with smoke from the
fires they employ in cooking their provisions. The house is entered
by a door in the centre of the floor, to which the inhabitants ascend
by means of a ladder. Against the wainscoat, immediately fronting
the door, is placed a small scaffold of carved wood, having upon it a
large dish, containing the skull of one of the forefathers of the owner
of the house, whose weapons are also hung around it. These consist
of bows made of bamboo, bound round with thread, and provided with
strings of buffalo hide, and of arrows three feet and a half long,
made of thin reed or rattan, with sharp iron points. With these they
are able to bring down a hen or other bird at the distance of sixty
or seventy paces, rarely or never missing their mark. In addition to
these weapons they have muskets, lances with iron points, old swords
and long parangs. These last, which they obtain from the Ceramese and
Macassars, have their handles covered with sharks' skin, and ornamented
with handsome shells, a small metal bell being usually appended to it.
The combs and necklaces of the inhabitants, which I shall describe more
fully when speaking of their mode of dress, are also displayed on this
stage. Round the interior of the house against the wall is erected a
framework, a foot and a half from the floor, which serves for beds by
night and for seats by day. These are occupied chiefly by the women,
the men squatting down on the floor in the centre of the room.

On the right side of the entrance is placed a clay fire-place,
supported by a wooden stand, on which the provisions of the inmates are
cooked, these last being kept upon a large shelf above the fire-place.
Their more valuable property is hung around on the wall, or preserved
under the benches which line the wall. Upon the whole, their dwellings
present an appearance of greater neatness than those of the inhabitants
of the islands to the westward.

Before reaching the village it is necessary to pass the spot where
their dead is deposited, the interment of whom is attended with
several curious ceremonies. The body is wrapped in cloth, usually
coarse Mirzapore chintz, and put into a coffin made of rough planks,
fastened with wooden pins, a dish being placed under the head. The
coffin is then taken to the burial ground, and wrapped round with the
above-mentioned coarse chintz, after which it is deposited on a stage
raised four or five feet from the ground. A piece of Mirzapore chintz,
fastened to a long bamboo stick, is hoisted over the burial place,
and a paling is erected round it, on which are hung baskets containing
fruits, cooked yams, fowls, rice and other provisions, which are
occasionally renewed. The heat of the sun, and the rains, soon cause
the chintz in which the coffin has been enveloped, to decay and fall
off, but it is immediately renewed, and another dish placed under the
skull. Should the body be that of a rich man, or of the relative of one
of the village chiefs, the skull is removed to the house, and placed in
a conspicuous spot, as I have before mentioned. If, on the other hand,
the body is that of a poor man, the remains are thrown together into a
cleft in a rock, or some such place, as soon as the coffin has decayed.
The bodies of malefactors are buried at once, without anything being
erected to mark the place of interment. The remains of human beings
are never to be seen scattered about, and it is extremely difficult
to obtain a skull from the natives. I have frequently seen the entire
skeleton through the sides of the coffin, when it has become full of
holes through age and decay. During still weather an intolerable smell
arises from these cemeteries; but the natives appear not to suffer the
least inconvenience from it.

The vessels of the natives are usually hauled up on the beach near
these burial places, and protected from the weather by sheds similar
to our boat-houses. These vessels are chiefly of the kind called
"_jonkos_," which are either built here or on the island Baba. They
are constructed of rough planks, fastened to each other by wooden
pins, and bound to the timbers with bands of rattan. Saws are never
employed in cutting the planks, neither are iron nails ever used in
the construction of their vessels. The sides of the _jonkos_ are held
apart by thwarts, upon which a deck of bamboos is laid, so that, when
complete, they may be considered as tight and seaworthy. The gunwale is
usually two or three feet above the level of the water. Their length
is from forty to fifty feet; breadth from ten to twelve feet; and they
carry from twelve to sixteen tons. A roof of _atap_ covers the whole.

Each village usually possesses two or three of these vessels, the
property of the entire community; but they have also numerous canoes
with outriggers, some of which are large enough to contain a thatched
habitation. These craft are employed in fishing, or in the transport of
goods from island to island.

On making enquiries concerning the trading vessels which came here, I
learned, among other things, that during the previous year a vessel
under the English flag had arrived at the east extremity of Timor-laut,
the master of which sent his boat on shore to purchase provisions,
giving out that he had been necessitated to visit the place from a
great mortality and sickness having occurred among his crew. In how far
this was the case, I will leave to the judgment of those who are aware
of the artifices of the English, in order to carry on a smuggling trade
in these parts,[35] and, above all, to import prohibited goods, such
as gunpowder and ammunition. Thus was the brig, in name (_dakleijen_),
loaded only with roofing slates and iron, but, in fact, she had a large
number of muskets, swords and other weapons on board. The captain
agreed with the natives to give weapons in exchange for stock, and
went on shore with half his crew, which consisted of ten Europeans.
In the mean time the natives considered this to be a fine opportunity
to overpower those who remained on board, and gain possession of the
vessel. They, therefore, boarded her unexpectedly in great numbers,
and murdered the people in her, while at the same time those on shore
were made away with, with the exception of two boys, who owed their
preservation to the interposition of the women. After this crime had
been committed, they hauled the brig on shore, stripped her of all they
could carry away, and burned her. The plundered goods were shared out
among the inhabitants, and part of them sold to the traders who visited
them, the remainder being kept, and now, perhaps, serving as finery for
the inhabitants of the east coast of Timor-laut. One of the village
chiefs stated to me on this occasion, that he had himself seen the
chain cable of the brig hanging around the village, and that two iron
carronades which had belonged to her lay there upon the ground, the
natives not having, yet mustered sufficient courage to fire them off.

I fixed the day subsequent to our arrival for a general meeting of the
people, at which I might make known the benevolent intentions of the
Government, and the object of my visit. One of the Orang Kayas of Serra
was accidentally here, making preparations for his return home, so that
I had a good opportunity of sending an invitation to all the chiefs of
that island to come and see me, as I could not promise with confidence
to visit them in their own villages.

We have already seen proofs of the desire shown by the natives
to adopt, in some particular or other, the mode of dress of our
countrymen. As may be supposed, they have no idea whatever of making
clothes, and this is the chief reason of their having such a ludicrous
appearance when clad in their European vestments. They were, therefore,
not a little delighted at finding that I had had several coats made on
board, of red, blue and green cloth, which I gave to them, in addition
to the Government presents. Garments of this description are not only
viewed as a dress of state, but are considered as distinguished tokens
of honour; and it will, therefore, readily be conceived that they
are preserved with the greatest care as heirlooms, and used only on
festive occasions.

Early on the morning of the 12th, I went on shore with a numerous
escort, and under the customary salute from the guns. In the middle of
the village of Watidal a booth had been erected, and covered with the
sails of vessels, under which were numerous seats of plank, the part
assigned to me, as Vakeel or Embassador of the Dutch Government, being
arranged with especial care, and covered with fine coloured calico.
Voluntary homage to our Government was apparent in all their actions.
The people not only filled the booth, but surrounded it on all sides,
leading me to believe that the entire population, young and old, were
present. The presents were received with the loudest expressions of joy
and thankfulness. The entire day was spent in installing the village
chiefs, and making arrangements for preserving peace and unity among
them. The villages are all independent of one another, each having its
own territory, consisting of a portion of land, and contiguous trepang
banks, and being governed by its own chief. So long, therefore, as
they respect the property of their neighbours, and live according to
the old usages of their forefathers, they remain in perfect peace with
each other. The upper chief, whom I appointed for Watidal, was an aged
man, not at all deficient in good sense and ability. He spoke very good
Malayan, although the language of the natives consists of a peculiar
dialect, in which point there is a remarkable difference between them
and the people of the neighbouring islands.

I could no where discover any remains which would point out that an
officer of the East India Company had resided here, whence I concluded
that the Dutch had not visited these islands for a long series of years.

The authority of our Government here was more necessary than one would
be led to suppose, from the state of society which exists among these
people. The chiefs are respected by the common men as the oldest,
the most experienced, and the richest among the inhabitants; they
are consulted when differences occur, and their decision is usually
respected; but they still want, to give force to their authority, an
act of appointment from our Government. The considerate reader, who
will already have perceived in the particulars previously related, how
fond these simple people are of outward show, will not be surprised to
find that such an installation is considered as an important epoch in
the history of their country, and that they wished to celebrate the day
on which they were visited by an officer of the Netherlands Government,
after so long a period of neglect, with all joy and solemnity, as a
national festivity.

The want of a formal act of appointment from the Dutch Government has
been attended with results very detrimental to the welfare of the
natives, especially those of Watidal. In the time of the Ceramese
Hongie-togten,[36] the chiefs of Watidal had been presented with
sticks provided with knobs, on which the arms of the Company were
engraven. This token of alliance with us was not sufficient to prevent
the covetous Ceramese from practising extortion upon them, and when
the chiefs complained openly to the Company, and stedfastly refused
all irregular contributions, the Ceramese did not hesitate to plunder
and rob them in open enmity. This would not have taken place had the
chiefs been appointed with more solemnity, and provided with regular
acts of appointment, in which case their subjects would have been more
subordinate to their control, and the Ceramese rovers would have been
withheld from plundering by dread of punishment.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE TENIMBER ISLANDS.

Visit to Watidal.--Respect shown to the Dutch Flag.--The English
supposed by the Natives to be _Orang-gunung_, or Mountaineers.--The
Prosperity of the People inseparable from the Rule of the Dutch over
these Countries.--Traces of the Christian Religion having formerly
obtained here.--Departure from Larrat to Vordate.--Allurements of
the latter Island.--The Inhabitants of the Tenimber Islands.--Their
Manners and Customs.--Mode of Warfare.--Striking Proofs of their
Attachment to the Dutch Government.

The English, during their short possession of the Moluccas, sent a
British flag to the people of Watidal, who had preserved it well, but
without making any use of it. When I demanded the reason of this, I
was answered that they plainly perceived that this was not a Company's
flag, and that they would not recognize any other nation than the Dutch
as their allies. Their ideas of the different European nations are
very singular. From their questions, it appeared that they considered
the _Orang Compania_ (the Dutch) only as true white people, and that
they were unacquainted with other Europeans. They asked me if the
English were not the inland mountaineers, or _Orang Gunung_, like the
inhabitants of Timor-laut, and other barbarous people.

The natives call themselves "_Anak Compania_," literally, Children
of the Company; and they often expressed to me their surprise at the
difficulties the traders who arrived at the island, threw in their way
to prevent them from visiting Banda. They also expressed themselves
much discontented at the arbitrary mode of trading adopted by the
native merchants from Banda, which had often necessitated them to be
their own judges, as they dared not nourish a hope that the Dutch would
again visit and defend them. This state of affairs caused them to
retrograde in point of civilization, as by continually taking revenge
for offences committed against them, they themselves have become wild
and rapacious, so much so that the Tenimber islanders are in bad repute
among their neighbours, being considered as dangerous characters. They
absolutely prohibited the Macassar traders from coming to the islands,
because the numbers in which these arrived gave rise to a fear on the
part of the inhabitants, that the traders would bring them under their
power, and treat them in an arbitrary manner, which, as they said, took
place too often already. It will readily be supposed, that it cost me
much time and trouble to induce the natives to renew their intercourse
with these people, and at the same time it will be perceived how much
extortion these simple, though numerous, islanders have been subjected
to since they lost the protection of the Dutch Government.

A Dutch garrison in these islands, although giving rise to an increased
government expenditure, would contribute greatly to extend the trade
of the Moluccas, and at the same time effect a humane object; for,
owing to the want of Dutch protection, the inhabitants of the Tenimber
Islands will be led to follow the example set them by their rapacious
visitors. Their desire to be governed by representatives of our
Government, is as great as that of the natives of the other islands,
and they would willingly afford them the necessary maintenance and
shelter.

I could not discover precisely at what period the Christian religion
obtained in these islands; but from having found some old Bibles among
them, coupled with other circumstances, I was convinced that it had
existed at some earlier period. I did not meet with an idol in any
of their villages. When saying their prayers they look up towards
heaven, in acknowledgment of a Supreme Being; but, as is usual among
uncivilized people, their religious ideas are coupled with the wildest
superstition. They are by no means averse to our religion, but, on the
contrary, express their willingness to adopt it. The firm resistance
they have made to the endeavours of the Mohammedan priests to convert
them is very praise-worthy, these never meeting with the least success
in their exertions. The people of Tenimber could never, I think, be
prevailed on to abstain from pork and spirituous liquors, and it is
possible that this is one of the reasons for their aversion to Islamism.

It soon came to my knowledge, that some serious differences had
occurred between some of the villages on Vordate, which had already
caused an appeal to arms. This spread general dejection among the
natives, as it entirely put a stop to the trepang fishery, the chief
source of their prosperity.

I used my utmost endeavours to induce some of the natives to visit
Timor-laut, in order to apprise the natives of my arrival, and, if
possible, to free the two English youths who had been saved from the
brig, the loss of which I have previously mentioned, but without
success. It appeared that they were at war with the people of
Timor-laut, and considered their force too small to afford hope of
success: this reason appeared to me so conclusive, that I could not
urge them farther. To proceed directly thither in person would not only
be acting against my instructions, but the smallness of the force at
my disposal rendered such a proceeding very unadvisable. Neither could
the boats attached to the brig, be of the least service in such an
expedition.

After having been employed the entire day, according to my
instructions, in attending to the affairs of the natives, the squally
appearance of the sky in the evening, made me determine to return to
the brig, leaving my clerk and the interpreters to obtain further
information. I had scarcely got on board when a heavy squall from the
land brought our bower-anchor home. The brig swung off, and hung by
the kedge; but this also broke before the bower-anchor had been hove
up, and, as we drifted off the bank immediately, it became necessary to
get the brig under sail. I therefore made a signal for those on shore,
who returned immediately; and as this was evidently an unfit place for
the brig to remain in, while it was still more unadvisable to stand
off and on, from the probability that existed of our being set on the
reefs, I stood at once towards Vordate, which we had previously passed
by owing to the assertions of our pilot, hoping we might find good
shelter there.

Early on the following morning we found ourselves close under the shore
of that island, when the boats were sent away to find anchorage; and I
was soon rejoiced by seeing the signal made which had been determined
on, in the event of their search being successful. I now chose our
anchorage close to the reef, and carried a cable on shore, which was
made fast to the trees on the middle of the bank. The bower-anchor lay
in thirty fathoms sand, while the brig was not more than three quarters
of a cable's length from the reef; rather too little room, perhaps, but
the situation did not appear to me as being dangerous, as the wind
always blows steadily off shore, and there was not sufficient current
to swing the brig on to the reef. A considerable period elapsed,
however, before we could bring the brig up, as the sand proved to be
bad holding-ground. The anchor dragged twice, and it was not until the
third attempt, when a warp had been carried on shore, that we succeeded
in making all fast. Several vessels, containing some of the principal
inhabitants, came rowing round the ship, on which I invited them on
board, and, receiving them with all possible friendship, cursorily
acquainted them with the object of my visit.

When seen from this side, the island appears hilly. The frontage
is covered with vegetation, and bears the appearance of possessing
uncommon fertility. Even the sides of the high hills were laid out
in beautiful gardens, the groves of cocoa-nut, and other large trees
that separated them, between which might often be perceived the
dwellings of the cultivators, presenting an agreeable variety to the
prospect. The splendid landscape that opened before us, the majesty of
the forest-crowned hills, the picturesque beauty of the entire tract
of country, and the luxuriant growth of the vegetation, altogether
offered too striking a view for my feeble pen to describe.

The north-east side of the island is uninhabited. On the north-west
side lie the villages of Sebiano and Adodo; while the south coast is
occupied by the villages of Ameer, Ewena and Romian. The only anchorage
is on the north-west side of the island, every other part being
surrounded by reefs, through which it is difficult to pass even with
boats at low water.

The inhabitants of the various islands of the Tenimber group bear much
resemblance to each other, in language, customs and other particulars.
They are usually well formed, and possess a fairer complexion than
most of their neighbours, while their features display few of the
characteristics of the inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago generally,
being more in accordance with those of Europeans, to whom they would
bear much resemblance were it not for the dark colour of their
complexion. In point of stature the women are superior to those of
the neighbouring island; the young ones especially, are uncommonly
handsome, their beauty being much increased by their simple mode of
dress instead of by fashionable attire, their costume consisting only
of a small piece of blue cloth worn round the waist. Men as well as
women wear several ornaments, such as gold and silver rings, of their
own manufacture, suspended from their ears, each of which is pierced
with several holes. The women are very partial to necklaces and
bracelets of small red beads, which, indeed, add much to their graceful
appearance.

The heaviest portion of the labour is performed by the women, the men
devoting themselves to warlike pursuits, the chase, the fishery and
commerce. Early in the morning the young unmanned women, under the
escort of three or four armed men, depart for the plantations in the
interior, and at sunset in the evening they may be seen returning,
laden with the produce of their labour, which they bear in baskets
upon the head. The married and elderly women, usually remain at home,
where they employ themselves in household affairs, tending the stock,
and preparing the meals. On the marriage of a young woman, she adorns
her ankles with one or two copper rings, which make a ringing noise
at every step, by no means disagreeable to the ear. These singular
ornaments give them a peculiar halting gait, the rings being from two
and a half to three pounds weight.[37] Some are carved with various
figures.

The natives of the lower class usually go entirely naked, only the
chiefs and heads of families, with those who have visited foreign
parts, wearing any clothing.

Their warlike equipment is very singular. Like the Ceramese, and other
Indian nations, they have their warriors or champions, who, when
preparing for war, anoint their heads abundantly with cocoa-nut oil,
and mix large bunches of loose hair with their own, which they raise
up in a towering manner by means of a large bamboo comb, adorned with
cock's feathers of various colours, to give them a fear-inspiring
appearance. Their hair is also confined by bands of coloured cloth,
studded with red beads, and ornamented with hanging shells. Round the
middle they wear a piece of dried buffalo's hide by way of armour, to
which is suspended their knife and their _klewang_ or cutlass. Large
golden rings are attached to the ears; the neck is protected by a
thick collar, studded with white shells; the costume of the warrior
being completed by bands of ivory, worked over with beads, worn on the
arms.

When they go to war with their neighbours all other occupations are
neglected, and they employ themselves in wandering through the forest,
watching for opportunities to carry off the enemy's women. Occasionally
the warriors call each other out, when a skirmish takes place; but
their warlike propensities are chiefly exercised in plundering, and in
waylaying the enemy when employed in his plantations or at the fishery,
but never coming to a regular open fight. More _sagoweer_, or palm
wine, is drank at this time than at any other, the cocoa-nut trees
being put to no other use than to supply the ingredients. Before the
tree bears fruit the blossom is enclosed in a case, the bottom of which
is cut every day, and an earthern pot, or a piece of hollow bamboo,
placed under to catch the sap, which, when fermented, acquires an
intoxicating power.

As on the islands visited during the previous part of the voyage, there
existed here differences, and wars arising from insignificant causes,
enduring for years, and never adjusted except by the accidental
mediation of traders or others from the neighbouring countries. Pride,
jealousy and exasperation prevent either party from taking the first
step towards reconciliation. Several examples of this will be given in
the ensuing pages.

Until late in the evening the arrival and departure of natives from
the shore never ceased. I sent my interpreters on shore to make known
the object of my visit in the various villages, and to call the chiefs
together to a general meeting. On the following morning one of the
boats, armed with two one-pounder guns, was sent in advance to the
village of Aweer, on the south-west point of the island, and I followed
soon after in another boat, accompanied by the gentlemen attached to
the commission. On stepping ashore we were saluted by a salvo from the
guns of the boat sent in advance, and were received with friendship
by a large concourse of natives clad in their war dresses. We first
entered the village of Aweer, where women and children, as well as
men, assembled around us, which, as I have previously remarked, always
affords an undoubted proof of friendship and confidence on the part of
the natives. We were much struck by the neatness of this village, and
the large amount of its population. We perceived no less than a hundred
handsome huts, built in the manner previously described.

The curiosity of the natives was very great, which is not very
surprising when it is considered that we were probably the first
Europeans they had ever seen. They could scarcely be satisfied
with narrowly viewing us on all sides. The Orang Kaya of Aweer, a
very well-mannered young man, welcomed us with many expressions of
friendship; and his handsome young wife, to whom he had lately been
married, kindly tendered us some _sagoweer_ and _tuak_, or palm-wine.

From here I proceeded to the village Ewena, where we were also received
with much courtesy. This is the centre one of the three villages which
lie on this side of the island, and the least populous. Romian, the
third, is situated farther to the eastward, none of them being more
than a musket-shot apart. The latter village is equal to Aweer in point
of population.

This day having been fixed on for a preliminary meeting of the chiefs,
at which we might learn something of their social state, I was unable
to tarry long at either of the villages. In passing I charged the
chiefs to bring all their wars and contentions to an end, and announced
to them that I should enquire into the causes of their differences, and
make an equitable adjustment of them.

When I desired to proceed to Romian, they wished to restrain me,
stating that they would be apprehensive for my safety, as the
people of Romian from jealousy at my having previously visited the
other villages, would probably make an attack on me.[38] Even the
interpreters were afraid to go there, until something more had been
learned concerning them. As I was aware, however, of the high respect
with which the natives in general view the Company, whom they regard
as their benefactors and allies, I went confidently towards the people
drawn up under arms, accompanied only by two unarmed seamen waving
the Dutch flag in front, a proceeding which the assembled multitude
witnessed with astonishment and alarm, not being able to conceive how
I dared to undertake it, without previously obtaining hostages for my
safety.

As I had expected, I was received with frankness and enthusiasm, and
admitted into the village with shouts of joy. Old and young, men
and women, viewed me as their deliverer in the need, and the welkin
rang with the cry of "_Salamat datang, Tuda Compania!_" (Welcome!
representative of the Company!)

In a few words I informed them of the object of the Government in
sending me here, and testified to them my anxious desire to establish
peace among them, to effect which they requested my assistance. On my
assuring them that the people of the other villages would lay down
their arms, they promised on their part to refrain from hostilities,
and to await with peace and quietness the effects of my intervention. I
also requested them to give free admission to my interpreters and the
other officials, that they might pursue the necessary enquiry.

In the mean time, I caused the presents which had been brought for
each village to be taken from the boats, and ordered the armed seamen
to approach; after which I permitted the letter of the Government to
be solemnly read and explained to them, and distributed the presents
to the chiefs. After having promised to come back and settle their
differences, I returned to Ewena and Aweer, where the presents of the
Government were also distributed, and received with great thankfulness;
the people expressing their sense of the kindness of the Company, and
stating anew how ardently they had longed for the return and assistance
of the Dutch Government, and how fortunate they would esteem themselves
were they again to be recognized as "_Anak Compania_," or children of
the Company. What may we not do with such people?

The day was spent in examining into their differences, and in
transacting the business which had been entrusted to me by the
Government; and towards evening I returned on board, promising to pay
them another visit on the following day.

I was able to leave these villages with much satisfaction, as I had
had another opportunity of seeing how ineffaceably the old Dutch
Government is fixed in the memories of these people; and also, as I had
had the good fortune to effect something towards promoting the welfare
of my fellow-men. The thought of having, by timely intervention, put
a stop to wars, murders, and running away with women, afforded me
more pleasure than I can express. This thought caused me to disregard
all difficulties, and encouraged me cordially to assist with my best
advice, this uncivilized, but, at the same time, uncorrupted and simple
people.

and Ewena.--The insignificant Cause which gave rise to it.--Successful
Attempts at Reconciliation.--Contribution towards giving a
Knowledge of their Character.--State of the Country.--Productions

We returned on board, accompanied by a numerous party of _Sohbats_,
or friends, a considerable number having preceded. I found that the
chiefs of Sebeano had been alongside, but without venturing on board:
they returned, however, on the following morning. I received this
numerous company on deck, the cabin being too small for so many guests.
A glass of arrack and a little Java tobacco formed the most acceptable
refreshment I could offer them. The chiefs of Sebeano and some others
were extremely alarmed, speaking in a tremulous manner, and being
scarcely able to bring out the words they wished to utter.

It accidentally happened that while we were sitting together on deck,
it became necessary to spread the awning, on which the officer of the
watch ordered the men aft to perform this duty. The word of command
for this is usually given with much quickness, and a number of men
instantly came aft to obey it, whose sudden appearance caused such a
panic in the breasts of the chiefs, that many of them sprang on their
feet in a moment, and some actually popped overboard through the ports,
while two of them rushed down the companion and concealed themselves
in the cabin. All this happened so suddenly, that at first I could
not imagine the cause. The others, who were somewhat acquainted with
the usages of a ship, remained seated, and laughed heartily at the
ungrounded fears of their more ignorant countrymen. The chiefs of
Sebeano now seeing their mistake, returned on board very much ashamed,
and making ludicrous gestures.

I returned to the shore in the morning, according to my promise,
having previously sent twenty seamen, according to my usual custom, to
add more solemnity to the meeting. In the mean time the interpreters
had returned, with the agreeable intelligence that the chiefs would
willingly receive my intervention, and abide by the decision I might
come to.

An enquiry into the causes of their wars will assist in giving an idea
of the disposition of these people: I will, therefore, give a short
account of the causes of the enmity which had arisen against the people
of Romian, which were as follows:--

The people of Romian happened to have more success at the trepang
fishery than the people of the other villages during two successive
years, which gave rise to an envious feeling on the part of their
neighbours, which was increased by a Chinese vessel having remained
at Romian to trade, while only one of the Chinamen belonging to her
proceeded to Ewena, to barter with the inhabitants. These circumstances
gave rise to distrust and estrangement, and the people of both villages
began to avoid each other, though without coming to an open rupture.

A third accidental circumstance which occurred, tended to enlarge the
breach. While the children belonging to the two villages were playing
with small bows and arrows, a child from Ewena happened to wound
slightly one of those from Romian. The inhabitants of the latter place
viewing the accident as an intentional offence, demanded satisfaction,
and whenever parties from each village met, they proceeded from words
to blows, and at length broke out into open war with each other. Each
party robbed the other of their women, destroyed their fisheries,
and put a stop to their agriculture, becoming more embittered at the
occurrence of every deed, until at length, a few weeks before my
arrival, a downright skirmish ensued, in which the people of Ewena had
one man killed and nine wounded, while ten belonging to the other party
were wounded also.

The people of Ewena, being the less powerful of the two, demanded
assistance from the inhabitants of Aweer, to some of whose warriors the
badge of honour, called the korra-korra,[39] was delivered. The parties
now became so exasperated, that there existed no possibility of those
who had not entered into the quarrel being able to pacify them, and
the strife soon extended to Larrat, and even to the more distant Serra,
where individuals, influenced by family connections, took up the cause
of one or the other party. Thus, we find in these distant parts of the
globe a confirmation of the fact, that wars and other important events
spring from the most insignificant causes. The narrative of these
differences afforded me a new proof of how unfortunate these ignorant
and uncivilized people are, when they are from under the protection
of the Dutch Government, and have been left to themselves for a long
series of years.

On my return to the shore I had the satisfaction to perceive, that both
parties had laid aside their weapons, but without having renewed their
former familiarity. I landed between the two villages, at a spot where
I had caused a tent of canvass to be erected, to shelter ourselves and
the escort.

As soon as I found that both parties would abide by my decision, I
judged it advisable to bring the chiefs together, and to reconcile them
as well as possible, in order to render it more easy to comply with
their mutual demands. I also hoped that by being brought together,
each party would be inclined to use more courtesy to the other, and I
did not hesitate to make them acquainted with my object, promising, at
the same time, that I would decide with justice and impartiality. I
promised also to stand security for the personal safety of the chiefs
of each party; but in spite of this I had the greatest difficulty in
inducing them to come forward, and place themselves, one party to the
right, and the other to the left of me and my men. Having, at length,
succeeded, I brought to their view the mutual detriment that ensued
from their discord. The Malayan language, in which I addressed them,
was interpreted to them by my linguists. After some time this address
appeared suddenly to affect them, and the chiefs of both parties burst
into tears, and unanimously entreated me to effect a reconciliation,
promising to make any reparation that I might think proper. I took
advantage of this favourable opportunity; and placing the hands of the
opposing chiefs together, wished that good fortune might attend their
reconciliation. This struck them so forcibly that they fell on each
other's necks, and a salvo was immediately fired from the muskets of
our party, and from the one-pounders in the boats. The chiefs now sat
down in a circle before the tent, and took _siri_ from each other's
boxes, as a solemn proof of sincere reconciliation, the interpreters
being also requested to partake of it. A glass of arrack was also
distributed to each of the by-standers by my steward, and by way of
strengthening the renewed friendship, my interpreter delivered a very
appropriate and affecting prayer, which met with a most enthusiastic
reception. Many of the words uttered by the interpreter were repeated
with fervour by the by-standers, from which it was evident that they
had been heard attentively.

After this I thought of making a visit to Sebeano; and leaving one of
the interpreters behind, withdrew from the assembly, with the promise
that I would afterwards enquire into the arrangement of their mutual
demands. I have already remarked that, under similar circumstances, the
natives should be left to their own deliberations for a certain time,
in order to arrive at the desired end.

From the speedy manner in which this reconciliation was effected,
it will perhaps be supposed, that the task of making peace among
these people is an easy one; but such is not the case. My patience
was sometimes nearly exhausted, for I was obliged to go, certainly,
ten times from one village to the other before I could induce the
contending parties to come together; and although it was always my wish
to effect my object by means of mild remonstrances, I was now and then
obliged to make use of serious threats. The good result which usually
attended my efforts, incited me to persevere and spare no trouble; but
yet, as it will subsequently appear, my labours were sometimes almost
insupportable.

On my return to the brig I found that it was too late to carry into
effect the plan I had proposed, and I therefore employed the following
day in attending to the affairs of Sebeano and the villages lying to
the northward, this mode of proceeding giving satisfaction to all
parties.

Sebeano, which consisted of about twenty houses, was situated on the
sea-coast, an hour's walk to the northward of our position; and two
hour's journey beyond this again, was Adodo, a village similar in
point of size and situation to the other. Midway between the brig
and Sebeano, a small river ran into the sea, from which we filled our
water. A still larger river emptied itself between Aweer and Ewena.

M. Dielwaart and myself, accompanied by the interpreters, spent the
early part of the morning in examining the island, which proved to be
tolerably well cultivated, and fertile in the extreme. Our path lay
over hills, the summits of which afforded us a beautiful prospect of
the surrounding country; fine fenced plantations, in which huts were
erected for watch-houses, being visible in every direction.

The stock produced on the island consists chiefly of hogs, goats and
fowls, the latter being in so great abundance, that three or four were
to be purchased for a chopping-knife. These knives, with thick brass
wire, parangs, dishes, basins, bottles, red beads, coarse cloths of
red and other colours, are the articles most in demand as payment for
stock and provisions. Dresses made at Great Timor and Kissa are also
much esteemed; as are elephants' tusks, gongs, Javanese dresses, and
gold and silver coin, the last being in demand for the manufacture of
ear-rings and other ornaments.

The fishery is carried on here in a very simple manner. Neither nets
nor lines are made use of, the fish being taken at the rising of the
tide by means of bamboo spears, some of which are provided with ten
or twelve small points,[40] while others have only a single barbed
point. Bows and arrows are used by others, who wade knee-deep over
the coral banks, which absolutely swarm with fish at that time of the
tide; indeed, the abundance is so great, that even by this simple
method a short time only is required to obtain sufficient for the daily
consumption.

On the 17th I held another meeting of the inhabitants of Ewena and
Romian, at which the entire population of these villages were present.
When installing the chiefs, whom they had chosen as their Orang Kayas,
I observed to them that this title of itself signified nothing, unless
they showed obedience to those who possessed it, and gave them much
other advice which appeared to me to be applicable to their situation.
The Orang Kaya of Aweer having been acknowledged on this occasion as
the highest in rank, I presented him with a silver-knobbed baton as a
token of his rank, while the others received flags to hoist in their
villages, and acts of appointment were drawn up for all.

The period from ten o'clock in the morning until two in the afternoon,
was passed in settling their old differences. The result was, that the
people of Ewena received back the korra-korra above-mentioned, giving
in exchange an elephant's tusk; the other affairs being adjusted in a
similar manner. We were then invited into the villages, to partake of
some refreshments that had been prepared for us, every thing affording
proofs of kindness and friendship.

After my return on board, several young men came to me for the purpose
of asking a passage to Banda, but I refused, giving as an excuse that
the brig was already full. These islanders willingly leave their
homes for a period, their object, I believe, being pure curiosity,
coupled with a desire to learn a little of the Malayan language, that
they may be viewed with greater respect on their return to their own
country. Every year some of them leave the island with the Amboynese
and Banda traders, who value them much, as they prove very useful on
board their vessels. Many occasionally reside at Banda in the Malayan
_kampong_, where they lead an idle life, occasionally catching fish,
but loitering away the remainder of their time. M. Camphuyzen, the
Resident, has often assured me that neither force nor kindness would
induce them to lead a laborious life. According to an old custom,
which obtains among the Tenimber islanders, those who have committed
misdemeanours are often forced to leave their country for a certain
time, who may return after a lapse of two or three years, when they
are received again with friendship. When the small-pox[41] or other
infectious disease appears among them, the patients are sent to the
island Mulo, and are not allowed to return until perfectly restored
to health. The relatives of these unfortunates show no compunction in
leaving them to their fate; and as no one approaches them when under
the affliction, they are forced to seek their own subsistence on the
shores and amid the forests of the island.

An Orang Tua of Ewena, named David, who, according to his own account,
was descended from Christians, joined me as interpreter for a very
slight remuneration. In his youth he had been at Amboyna and Banda,
where he had made great progress in the Malayan language, this
accomplishment rendering him of great service to us. He frequently
assured me, that the submission of the Tenimberese was not to be
depended upon, and only arose from the great dread they entertained of
the Company; but I thought that I had reason for placing no belief in
what he stated. It will appear, however, from what follows, that the
satisfaction I experienced at Vordate soon had a most unpleasant set
off.

Having determined to pay a visit to Kalioba, a village on Larrat,
immediately opposite to Aweer, and having a smaller village, situated
a little to the northward, under its rule, I left the brig with two
boats, accompanied by M. Dielwaart, Mr. Leydelmeyer the writer,
Mr. Cadet Bolk, and the interpreters. Our reception was apparently
courteous: the Dutch flag waved in the village, two shots were fired
from _lelahs_, and a portion of the villagers appeared on the beach
to meet us. I judged, however, from their behaviour and warlike
appearance, that we were not so welcome as it seemed, and my opinion
was soon confirmed.

We were not invited to enter the village, and as two boat-sheds were
erected on the beach, one of which was empty, we took up our quarters
under it, and brought the goods up out of the boats, which by this
time were no longer afloat, the reefs having fallen dry for some
distance out to sea. As the natives continually pressed around us, we
posted sentries round the shed, who had great difficulty in keeping out
the crowd. With a view to inspire them with confidence, I went entirely
unarmed and alone into the village, and visited the chiefs and elders
in their houses. Neither women nor children were to be seen, and on my
remarking this, I was answered that they had gone out to labour in the
plantations.

Our arrival had not been unexpected, as it had already been announced
to them from Vordate. The uncourteous reception I met with, therefore,
annoyed me extremely, as it could not be otherwise than premeditated.

In the meantime I invited the chiefs to approach me, and made them
acquainted with the object of my visit, informing them of the good
intentions of the Government; after which I caused the letter to be
read to them, and distributed the presents, which were similar in every
respect to those given to the chiefs of Vordate. They were received,
however, with the greatest indifference, as if they conferred a favour
on us by accepting them, and any remarks that I made on the subject
were scarcely listened to. Until late at night they continually
importuned us for arrack in the most rude manner, and even went so far
as to take away the bottles from among our things without asking leave.
We found it to be necessary to take the greatest precaution; and this,
coupled with the indifference of our dwelling, which admitted both wind
and rain, caused us to pass a very unpleasant night.

From the early part of the morning we were again annoyed by people
asking for arrack. We requested the chiefs to furnish us with
some water and two earthern pots, in which to cook rice and other
provisions, but we received neither; and I was necessitated to send
the seamen to a river, a quarter of an hour's walk from us, to obtain
some of the former, there being no wells near the village. In the early
part of the morning a number of women passed us laden with faggots and
bamboos full of water, the rattling of the rings on their legs creating
a sound similar to that made by the movements of a gang of chained
criminals.

I had given permission to two of the seamen to enter the village, with
the view of purchasing some goats and fowls; but these soon returned,
stating that they had received very unfriendly treatment in the
village, and had been unable to obtain anything. One of them having
laid down his handkerchief, found that it was gone when he returned to
take it up. I requested the chiefs to cause it to be given up, but did
not succeed in obtaining it, until I had paid the owner of the house in
which it was lost, the value of two rupees.

In the morning I commenced again with my duties, but had the greatest
difficulty in bringing the chiefs together, those who had received
the presents being the least willing to make their appearance. Others
represented themselves as chiefs who were not so, and demanded similar
presents in a brutal manner, going away grumbling on my refusing to
comply with their demands. Neither threats nor remonstrances appeared
to have any effect upon them. Although I was extremely annoyed at
their proceedings, I could not help attributing it to downright
stupidity, and I trust that I have not formed a wrong opinion. They
seemed totally to disregard the goodness of the Government, and to
forget that my visit was made to them at their own invitation. They
requested, however, that I would install their chiefs in the name of
the Government, which I complied with, at the same time letting them
know that I should assuredly inform the Government of the unfriendly
reception I had met with from them.

At four o'clock in the afternoon, when high water occurred, we embarked
on board the boats, without the chiefs seeming to care more about us,
and left this inhospitable place. We now stood towards Watidal, the
village off which the brig had anchored on our first arrival, where
we took up our quarters under a boat-shed, and after having received
a visit of welcome from the chiefs, made up for our want of rest the
previous night by a quiet slumber. On the following morning we hauled
the boats up to repair some leakages, and dried the articles which
had been wetted by the rains we experienced at Kalioba. We afterwards
visited the chiefs, and I have the satisfaction of saying, that we
were received with the same kindness as before, but somewhat less than
that we had experienced at Vordate, which may be attributed to their
inferior state of civilization. My steward obtained some fowls, eggs,
yams and cocoa-nuts, in exchange for knives, brass-wire, and pieces of
cloth. From these we prepared a meal, of which two of the Orang Kayas
partook.

In the afternoon a large prahu arrived from Serra, bound to Larrat and
Vordate on a trading voyage, on board which was one of the chiefs of
the former island, who had come for the purpose of paying me a visit.
He informed me that the other chiefs would also have come, but were
withheld by having heard that the brig had departed from Larrat, they
not knowing where she was gone to. The Orang Kaya proceeded with his
vessel to Vordate, promising that he would soon return to Serra; and as
it appeared to me advisable to pay a visit to that island, particularly
as the people in the prahu expressed a strong desire that I should do
so, I determined to commence my voyage thither immediately.

Having landed, towards evening, on the north-west point of Timor-Laut,
I witnessed a very singular ceremony. About twenty women, ornamented
with beads, appeared walking in line with stately steps, some bearing
bunches of plantains, and others baskets of yams or cocoa-nuts. Two
men, armed with large parangs and other weapons, preceded and followed
the train, the whole keeping their eyes fixed on the ground, and
bending their steps towards the spot where they deposited their dead.
I perceived that they came out of a hut in the forest where they
had assembled; and following them at a distance, I found that they
decorated the grave of one of their countrymen with what they had
brought, and with signs of strong feeling, turned again towards their
homes.

The chiefs of the circumjacent villages fitted out a small prahu in
conjunction, which was intended to accompany me to Serra, to the crew
of which I paid a small salary. It was necessary for me to obtain such
a vessel, as the boats were too full to carry sufficient water for
the voyage. The eldest son of the Orang Kaya, who was also one of the
village chiefs, having agreed to accompany me, we left our bivouac on
the afternoon of the same day, and pursued our voyage towards Serra.

Maktia.--Occurrences there.--One of the Crew severely wounded.--Return
towards Vordate.--Return of the Envoys to Serra.--Want of

After having passed the night on the island Teen, under the coast of
Timor-Laut, we pursued our voyage early on the morning, and passed
through a number of small islands, without meeting with any occurrence
worthy of remark. Turtle of an enormous size often made their
appearance on the surface, and trepang lay on the banks in the greatest
abundance. The greater number of the islands are rocky, with trees upon
them; but these had almost entirely lost their leaves, owing to great,
heat and want of rain. There are numerous channels through the shoals
which fill this part of the sea, but they are so small and crooked that
the navigation proves very difficult. The larger vessels, which pass to
and from Serra, keep to the westward of the course we pursued.

Towards noon the falling of the tide prevented us from proceeding,
and we therefore landed on Maling island, a little to the eastward of
Laboba, the latter island being distinguished from the others by a
peaked hill, raised about seven hundred feet above the level of the
sea, from the summit of which we saw the land of Timor-Laut over the
tops of the numerous small islands lying to the eastward. Laboba is
rocky, but covered with trees; and a stream of fresh water exists on
the east side, running down from the hill. A number of islands and
reefs lie to the westward of this island, shutting it in from the open
sea. The vessel of the son of the Orang Kaya, which accompanied us, was
unable to keep way with our boats, and did not arrive until two hours
after us.

After we had landed, I permitted the crew to haul the seine, and at two
draughts we obtained abundance of very delicate flavoured fish. We met
with no game, however, except numbers of sea-mews, which roosted on the
island at night, their days being employed in seeking sustenance over
the adjacent waters.

Towards evening we again continued, having arranged that the Orang Kaya
should await our arrival at the point of Maktia, a spot about twenty
miles distant from Serra, that he might procure fresh water for us from
the adjacent village. He expected to be there before us, as he purposed
running close along the coast of the main island, which the small
draft of his vessel would enable him to do, and there, during calms or
contrary winds, he would find no difficulty in pushing his vessel along
by means of long bamboos.

The light of the full moon enabled us to continue rowing throughout
the night, but the shallowness of the water prevented our reaching
Maktia Point, and forced us to remain at Wau Island until the tide
should rise. So heavy a dew fell during the night, that we were all
wet through before morning. This had a very injurious effect on the
health of my fellow-voyagers; M. Dielwaart and myself being afflicted
with dreadful pains in the stomach, while many of the seamen were
attacked with the same disease, or with agues. The Orang Kaya had spent
the night upon one of the other islands, and joined us in the morning,
when we proceeded as fast as the wind would permit towards Maktia, as
we already began to feel the want of water. I had now hopes of having
an interview with the inhabitants of Timor-Laut, and of being of some
service to them.

When seen from a distance, the ten or twelve houses which form the
village present a pretty appearance. The mud bank, which fronts the
shore, is dry at low water to the distance of a mile to seaward, but
the state of the tide permitted us to advance within musket range of
the beach, where the boats grounded; and as no harm could ensue, they
were permitted to lie in the mud. The Orang Kaya sent one of his men on
shore, who would not enter the village, but called to the inhabitants
from a distance. The village appeared to be abandoned, for we saw no
one but two unarmed men who were leaving it.

Although neither the Orang Kaya nor myself suspected the inhabitants of
any bad intentions, I judged it advisable for us to be on our guard.
I therefore, in the first place, sent a detachment of armed seamen,
accompanied by the people of the Orang Kaya, into the forest beside the
village, to search for water, but they returned without having found
any. As the Orang Kaya assured me that water would be found within the
village, I sent the men in, and they succeeded in obtaining two bamboos
full. They saw no one in the village, and in accordance with my orders
did not enter any of the houses, but returned straight to the beach,
and kindled a fire to cook some rice and other provisions. I, also,
went on shore to obtain an interview with the natives if possible, but
not meeting with any one, I caused a small flag and a piece of cloth
to be brought from the boat and hung up to one of the trees. At this
moment two unarmed men made their appearance at a distance, and I had
scarcely returned to the beach for the purpose of entering the boat,
when several arrows were shot from the thicket, one of which struck J.
Moll, one of the seamen who were collecting wood. He immediately threw
away his arms, and called out for assistance, on which he was carried
into the boat, while two of his comrades ran into the thicket to search
for the offender, but without meeting with success.

It was a fortunate circumstance that the fears of the natives induced
them to run away immediately after this transaction, for their
unexpected attack caused great confusion among us. Two inexperienced
seamen left their arms on the beach, and ran to the boats, but I caused
two others to take them up, and post themselves near the forest: the
natives, however, did not make their appearance.

The wounded seaman had left his arms behind in the forest. I sent
several men to obtain them, some shots being previously fired to
prevent their being again attacked. They found the weapons untouched,
and also picked up several of the arrows that had been shot at us. The
wounded man was laid down in the boat, and taken as much care of as
possible. One arrow had struck him in the right knee, and another had
entered the right buttock; the last wound bleeding very much, creating
great weakness, and producing a pain in the heart. The arrows possessed
flat iron points, like those I have previously described.

The Orang Kaya wished me to take his men, fifteen in number, and the
seamen, for the purpose of burning the village; but being unwilling
to act with hostility, I told him that the Government had recommended
me to pursue peaceable measures only, and that I should leave them to
punish the villagers. I judged it unadvisable to pursue the course
he proposed, particularly as the burning of the village would injure
the natives but little, while we, with our small force of only ten
Europeans and some Javanese seamen, would be by far the greatest
sufferers, were any of our people to be killed or wounded. Shortly
after this we heard a gong beat in the forest, which the Orang Kaya
informed me was intended to call together their force, stating that
it was necessary for us to be on our guard. The water did not rise
sufficiently to float the boats until seven o'clock: during the
intermediate time we occasionally fired shots from the boat-gun, with
the view of cooling the ardour of the natives should they be inclined
to attack us.

Owing to the small amount of force at my disposal, the number of the
sick, and the helpless condition of the wounded seaman, whose life
could be saved only by prompt medical assistance, I deemed it best to
leave this place as soon as possible, the more from the occurrences at
Kalioba having given me cause for distrust.

To prevent the expedition from being entirely useless, I proposed to my
interpreter, De Haan, a man who had been in the habit of trading with
these people, and was much respected by them, that he, with the chief
interpreter and the Orang Kaya, should proceed to Serra, and acquaint
the chiefs of the intention I had had to visit them. I much regretted
that this wearisome journey had proved so fruitless, and only found
consolation in the hope that I should have inspired the chiefs of Serra
with a just idea of the interest our Government took in their affairs,
especially as Serra was one of the chief trading places, and most
populous island in these parts. Our goods were, therefore, removed from
the prahu, and the envoys stepped into her, taking with them a little
arrack and other articles, in order, if possible, to induce the chiefs
to visit us at Vordate. I was now forced to give up the hope of being
able to free the two English youths, who were in captivity among the
natives of Timor-Laut.

We rowed and sailed throughout the night, with the view of reaching
Laboba as speedily as possible, to obtain a supply of fresh water. The
wounded man grew worse, his pains being increased by continually lying
in a crooked position, from the small size of the boat, and not having
had his wounds properly dressed. At noon, on the 23rd, we landed in a
bay on the east side of this island, having tasted no water since the
previous evening, while for forty-eight hours previously no provisions
had been dressed, our sustenance during that period having consisted
of biscuit and sago bread. The stream of water, which descended from
the hill, was weak and troubled; but was, nevertheless, very acceptable
to us. The wounded man, who was wearied out with heat and thirst, was
taken on shore and laid under the shade of a tree, fresh bandages being
applied to his wounds. The fatigues we had undergone caused us to sleep
soundly under the trees, in spite of the furious bites of a number of
red ants.

Several of the men cooked and ate some beans they had found on the
island, but soon had cause to repent their temerity, as five of them
were carried into the boats afflicted with violent pains in the
intestines, from which they were relieved by strong vomiting. These
beans, which much resembled our _spersie_ beans, were of a yellow
colour, and covered with blue spots.

Towards evening we left the island, and ran close along the coast of
Timor-Laut, passing continually over banks and reefs, a fresh southerly
breeze pushing us rapidly along. An hour after midnight the unfortunate
seaman died, and on the following morning, when we reached the brig,
tired and hungry, his body was committed to the deep with the usual
ceremony of a naval funeral.

The Orang Kaya of Watidal, who had come here with several vessels to
purchase provisions, came on board to pay us a visit, and promised to
return in company with the other chiefs. I sent the Orang Tua David on
shore, to inform the chiefs of Vordate of my arrival, and to invite the
before-mentioned chief of Serra on board the brig.

I was prevented by indisposition from going on shore the following day,
although I was anxious to visit Aweer. As soon as I found myself in a
fit state to leave the vessel, I went round to the different villages,
and employed myself until the 29th with the affairs and differences
of their inhabitants, much patience being required for this duty, on
account of the number of disagreeable circumstances attending it.
A number of canoes came alongside daily, the owners bringing stock
and vegetables to dispose of for knives and brass wire. The chiefs
continually came on board for the purpose of begging something;
every article they saw attracted their cupidity, and they showed no
hesitation in asking for it.

Early in the morning of the 29th, the agreeable intelligence was
brought to me, that six large prahus were in sight, coming from the
direction of Larrat, which proved to belong to the chiefs of Serra,
who, with the interpreters I had sent to them, came alongside at eight
o'clock. At first they were afraid to come on board, but after I had
personally conversed with them they ran up the side, followed by their
numerous retinue, and were received by me with the greatest friendship.
They expressed their regret at the event that had occurred at Maktia,
and assured me that if I would stay a short time, they would place the
offenders in my hands, and that they would revenge the disgrace that
had been cast upon them all in a most summary manner. I told them,
however, that the moderation I had shown towards the people of Maktia,
afforded a strong proof of the kind disposition of our Government,
while I hoped that such a misdeed would never be committed again. The
number of my visitors being too great for all to be entertained on
board, the meeting was adjourned to the shore, where the prahus of the
newcomers were hauled up on the beach. As I wished to detain them at
Vordate until our departure, that they might become acquainted with
the mode of proceeding adopted by the officers of our Government, I
permitted rice and other provisions to be distributed among them during
their stay.

The report given by the interpreters of the reception they had met with
at Serra, gave me great satisfaction, and made me regret having been
unable to proceed there in person. I went on shore at high water with
the usual ceremonies, and after having read the Government letter to
the assembled chiefs, and distributed the presents, I conversed with
them concerning the occurrence on Timor-Laut, at which they expressed
much regret. They also promised that henceforward they would be more
circumspect in their transactions with the foreign traders, and would
themselves visit Banda during the present year for commercial purposes.
A number of large jonkos went this year to Baba, Luan, Lette, and
others of the islands to the westward, for the purpose of exchanging
gold and calicoes for rice, sago and other products.

Among the chiefs of the island Serra, who were installed this day, was
one called Linum, who was appointed as chief Orang Kaya of Walusa. I
gave him a silver-knobbed baton, and a large Dutch flag, presenting the
others with certificates of appointment. It appeared to me, upon the
whole, that the people showed but little respect for the authority of
the chiefs. I conversed with them on this subject, explaining to them
the duties of the governors and the governed, and had the satisfaction
of seeing that my discourse made a lively impression upon them. I
shall pass over in silence the difficulties I experienced, in giving
these ignorant men a clear knowledge of the mode of proceeding adopted
by our Government, and in making them appreciate the value of the
philanthropic views of our rulers.

I never met with greater beggars than these people. Although the
presents I distributed among them were of greater value than those
which had been given on the other islands, some of the former
chiefs had the barefacedness to ask for clothes and other articles,
notwithstanding my having repeatedly told them that they ought to be
contented with what they had received.

The chiefs of Serra and Sebeano returned with me on board, to taste the
so-much esteemed arrack. I caused the interpreter to purchase some hogs
and goats for the seamen, at a tolerably high price.

Early on the following day I sent Lieutenant Bruining on shore with
thirty men to march to Aweer, (the boats being too small to convey
them), while I proceeded direct to the spot at which we had formerly
assembled, between Awena and Romian. On landing, the people of the
neighbouring villages, together with those of Serra, collected around
us; and I employed myself until four o'clock in the afternoon, in
transacting the business connected with my mission; when I informed
the assembly of my proposed departure for Amboyna, and left them with
the pleasing conviction, that our visit to these islands had not only
been of great service, but had given the highest satisfaction to their
inhabitants. The chiefs accompanied me on board, and expressed their
thanks for the kindness shown to them by the Government, promising also
to obtain the freedom of the two English youths on Timor-Laut, and to
bring them to Banda.

On the 30th of September, after having rewarded the Orang Tua David,
and the crew of the prahu that had been in our service, with some
_baftas_, knives, parangs, brass wire, plates, &c., we took leave of
our native friends, and weighed anchor to return to Banda, at which
place we arrived on the 3rd of October. We here landed the pilot,
Ali-Ali, and after a short stay continued our voyage to Amboyna,
arriving there on the 8th. The reader will readily conceive how
rejoiced we were, after so long an absence, to set foot again on the
beautiful island of Amboyna, where we were received by our families
and friends with lively congratulations. In addition to the pleasure
which this reception gave me, I had the satisfaction of finding my
exertions approved of by the Governor of the Moluccas, M.P. Merkus,
by which respected and hospitable officer I was invited to reside at
his country-house of Batu-Gadja. My agreeable residence there caused
me soon to forget the fatigues I had undergone, so that I soon after
undertook new expeditions to Ternate, Monado, and other places, the
description of which I shall pass over, those being places tolerably
well known, and proceed to give the reader an account of my second
voyage to the parts which form the subject of my work.

CHAPTER XVII.

THE CERAM-LAUT AND GORAM ISLANDS.

Preparations for a Voyage to New Guinea.--Departure from
Amboyna.--Banda.--Arrival at Kilwari.--Ghissa.--Character of the
Inhabitants.--Visit from the Chiefs of Kilwari and Keffing.--Their
Wars.--Force of the Islanders.--The Ceram-Laut Islands.--Their
Vessels.--Commerce.--Exclusive Right assumed by the Inhabitants over
the Coast of New Guinea.--Smuggling Trade of the English.--Papuan
Pirates devour their Prisoners.--Slaves.--Sale of Children by their
Parents.

Having given my reader a circumstantial account of my voyage to the
South-west, South-east and Arru Islands, I will now proceed with the
narrative of a voyage undertaken by me, by order of the Government,
to examine the coasts of New Guinea and the adjacent islands, the
objects being similar to those which gave rise to the former voyage. I
received, on this occasion, a resolution of the Government, from which
I give the following extract:--

"1st.--The acts of M.D.H. Kolff, Lieutenant in the Navy of the First
Class, during his voyage to the South-west, South-east and Arru
Islands, are approved of on the whole, with thanks for the perfectly
satisfactory manner in which he has carried his orders into effect.

"2nd.--The appointment of the chiefs made by M. Kalff are to stand
good, and certificates of the same are to be drawn up.

"3rd.--The Captain in the Navy, Commandant of the Division, is to send
H.M. brig _Dourga_, under command of Lieutenant Kolff, on another
voyage in the Banda Seas as far as the coast of New Guinea, in order
to make an examination of the same, &c., according to a letter of
instructions hereafter to be drawn up. Extracts from this to be
furnished to Lieutenant Kolff for his information and direction.

"True copy from the Register.
"Signed (W.G.) Paape."

For the sake of brevity, I will refrain from inserting other
resolutions of the Government, approving of the distribution I had made
of the presents, together with the new instructions with which I was
provided for the present voyage.

Having obtained these documents, and all other necessary articles,
I was speedily prepared for the task that had been imposed upon me.
I will now offer the reader an account of my discoveries, and the
remarkable occurrences which took place, pursuing the same method of
simple narrative with that adopted in the former part of the work, and
endeavouring to avoid all useless particulars.

I had brought with me from the Bay of Boni, a large boat belonging
to the Harbour Department, and as it was evident that I should
occasionally have to send out boat expeditions, for which the four
belonging to the _Dourga_ were unfit, I was permitted to take it with
me. This boat, which was thirty-six feet long, and armed with an
eighteen-pounder gun, was too heavy to be carried on the deck of the
brig; but as I had before proved her to be a good sea-boat, I did not
hesitate to let her sail in company. I received on board a party of
military, but, to my regret, some of my former companions remained
behind from sickness, among whom was the surgeon, M. Gayser, Officer of
Health of the 2nd Class, M. Pierson coming in his stead.

We left Amboyna on the 26th of March, but continued calms prevented
our reaching the picturesque island of Banda until the 1st of April.
According to my instructions, I was to obtain here the advice of the
Resident, with pilots and interpreters for New Guinea; but as none of
the latter were to be met with here, I judged it best to proceed to
the Ceram-Laut Islands, where I should be likely to obtain them. The
Resident informed me that a war existed between the people of Kilwari
and Keffing, and that the interposition of the Government had been
requested by several of the tribes. The Commandant Kaltaay, who resided
in Kilwari, had come with several others to Banda for this purpose,
and had furnished the Resident with the particulars of the affair. His
declaration was placed in my hands, with the request that, as I should
probably visit these islands, I would endeavour to make peace between
the hostile parties, since their wars had greatly injured the native
trade, and thereby caused a great want of provisions at Banda. The
Commandant Kaltaay had three jonkos with him, which followed the brig,
while he, with three of his retinue, took passage with us.

On the 5th of April we left the Roads of Banda, with our little
flotilla in company, and were again detained on our voyage by calms,
being unable to reach the channel between Keffing and Ghissa until the
8th. We passed along the edge of the reefs which front the north coast
of the latter island, and came to anchor in the mouth of the channel
which separates it from the Ceram-Laut Islands.

Ghissa is a low, sandy, uninhabited island, surrounded on all sides
by reefs, which extend farthest to seaward from the south end. In the
centre of the island is a lagoon, communicating with the sea by a
channel on the north side, which absolutely swarms with various kinds
of fish, while its shores abound with ducks and snipes. Ghissa was once
inhabited; but a war having broken out between the people and those
of Kilwari, the latter obtained the upper hand, and drove the others
from their island, forcing them to take refuge on Ceram-Laut and the
adjacent places, while everything they left behind was destroyed. From
this period the island had remained unoccupied. A small portion of the
former population still resided on Ceram-Laut, under the rule of a
chief in subjection to the people of Kilwari, the latter treating them
in a most barbarous manner.

Having anchored close to the villages on Kilwari, a gun was fired from
the brig as a signal that a vessel of war had arrived, and that the
chiefs were required to come on board.

This group of islands is known among the natives by the name of Pulo
Ceram, (though each has a separate name), from the inhabitants being
either descendants of the people of Great Ceram, or fugitives from that
island, and following the Ceramese laws and customs. The inhabitants of
this range of islands are all Mohammedans, and bear much resemblance in
every particular to the professors of the same religion at Amboyna, and
the other Molucca Islands.

Kilwari is a small sandy island, overspread with houses, lying to the
west-north-west of Ceram-Laut, to which it is joined by a sand-bank.
The inhabitants are under the rule of the Raja of Kilwari, and the
Commandant Kaltaay, the subjects of the latter forming a small portion
only of the population residing on the west side of the island. The two
villages are separated from each other by a stone wall, six feet high,
and two in thickness, a similar defence surrounding the island. The
houses, which are usually raised three or four feet from the ground,
have a very poor and neglected appearance, but those of natives of
consequence are enclosed by a substantial stone wall.

Coral reefs extend for a considerable distance from the island,
rendering it difficult of approach to ships. The village appeared to me
to be within reach of our guns, and should it be necessary to attack
them, it would be possible to approach within musket-shot. The best
landing-place, on such an occasion, would be a bay on the north side
of the island; but boats could easily pass over the reefs. The place
could easily be taken by a single square-rigged vessel, and some small
craft. It is owing only to their defenceless position that the natives,
who are naturally turbulent and rapacious, show any respect for the
commands of our Government. Being aware of the mildness of our rule,
they often take advantage of it, and enter into the smuggling trade in
nutmegs and cloves, which they exchange for gunpowder and arms, as will
be seen hereafter.

We had not long been at anchor when the Raja of Kilwari, with all his
chiefs, came on board with much solemnity to pay his respects, at
the same time testifying his joy at the kindness of the Government
in offering to be the mediator between the contending parties. He
expressed his willingness to abide by my decision, and to cease
hostilities against Keffing, should I command it.

I sent my clerk with an interpreter to the Major of Keffing, the chief
of part of that thickly populated island, to invite him on board, with
promise of safe conduct, on which he came to the ship. I subsequently
returned the visit of both chiefs at their villages, and was received
with great state. The war had ceased from the moment of my arrival.
On enquiry it appeared to me, that the people of Kilwari had been the
aggressors, and it was arranged that they should pay a fine, on which
I caused both parties to meet at the village of Kelu on Keffing, and
reconciled them in the Ceramese mode. I was engaged until the 13th in
deciding their differences, and although their state of civilization
is higher than that of most of the tribes I visited during my previous
voyage, the decision of disputes nowhere cost me more difficulty or
required more patience. I will refrain from giving a full account of
the causes of these disputes, as they would occupy too much space, and
will merely give the outline. Several months previous to our arrival,
the chiefs of Keffing and Kilwari fell out, the quarrel arising from
mutual jealousy, which found vent in taunts, the usual mode in which
the natives manage to create dissensions among themselves. They had
already met with their flotillas of korra-korras, and had fought,
after their manner, with great obstinacy and bloodshed. The people
of Kilwari had been the attacking party, for which reason they were
adjudged to pay a fine of two cannons, an elephant's tusk, and some
other trifles. According to the custom of the Ceramese, the payment of
a fine, coupled with an acknowledgment of having done wrong, puts an
end to hostilities; the punishment for all sorts of offences, robbery,
and even murder, being commutable to a payment of elephants' tusks,
lelahs, gongs, cloth, &c. Some villages possess a peculiar hereditary
right connected with the payment of fines, which are respected by the
others. For example, as a fine for the same offence, Kilwari would pay
to Keffing two _bagians_ or proportions, while Keffing would disburse
to Kilwari only one _bagian_. All these usages are called _Adat Ceram_,
and those who do not respect them draw upon themselves the enmity of
all parties. Their differences are often settled by a meeting of the
other chiefs; but such a devouring jealousy obtains among them, that
nothing gives greater satisfaction than punishment inflicted by our
Government on one of the parties. A threat made by me to call in the
assistance of the neighbouring chiefs, and punish the Raja of Kilwari,
if he continued obstinate, had the greatest effect upon him, and gave
much satisfaction to the other chiefs.

The power of the native chiefs is more or less in proportion to their
riches. An ancient Ceramese saying is to this effect:--"If he is a
Raja, I am one also. While I have vessels, slaves, _lelahs_, powder and
shot, with money to pay warriors, I will make war on the first chief
who offends me, and if I gain the victory all Rajas will come and kiss
my feet."

The chiefs take care that none of their subjects shall collect too much
property, as they know well how to reduce his wealth by imposing fines,
and other modes of extortion. The contributions, or as they are called
here, as well as by us, the tithes paid to the chiefs by the people,
forms by no means so ample a portion of their income as that derived
from the hereditary services performed by them, such as building their
houses, and keeping them in repair, and from the presents of stock,
fruit and other productions wrung from the unwilling hands of the
peasants. These extortions, which render the native rule so burthensome
to the people, are enforced, indeed, throughout India.

Ceram-Laut is encompassed by several smaller islands, the whole being
surrounded by an extensive coral reef, on the edge of which, at low
water, is found a depth of from two to four fathoms. The reef runs
steep off, there being an unfathomable depth a little beyond it, which
renders it dangerous of approach. The centre, which is also the largest
of the islands, is high and hilly. An exceedingly high tree upon it,
under which the chiefs of Kilwari are interred, raises itself far above
the others, and forms a good land-mark for seamen. The population is
small. The fugitives from Ghissa are settled on the west side, and
over the face of the island are scattered some natives of Tehor (an
island about midway between Ceram and the Ki Islands), who have been
driven from their country by their powerful neighbours, together with
a number of other unfortunates who have been forced to leave their
native island, Sumbawa, from the destruction caused by the eruption
of the Timboro Mountain in 1814. The condition of these strangers is
little better than that of slaves to the people of Kilwari, to whom
they are obliged to deliver the fruits of their labour, consisting
of rice, Indian corn, oil, &c.; while they are also forced to attend
their oppressors as rowers in their prahus, whenever they fit out
their flotillas for a warlike excursion. The slaves obtained from the
adjacent coasts of New Guinea, who are not quickly sold at Kilwari, are
also kept upon Ceram-Laut until the state of the market becomes more
favourable.[42]

The vessels employed by the natives of these islands differ from each
other considerably. Those employed for war are long and narrow, lying
low in the water and lightly built, a stage projecting from the sides,
on which the rowers take their station. A house is erected in the
middle for the fighting portion of the crew, on the flat roof of which
their chief warriors perform the war-dance. Across the forepart of
the vessel is placed a thick barricade made of light wood, provided
with ports, through which the lelahs or great guns are pointed, thus
affording protection to the rowers from musket shots, as the attack is
always made stem on, the sides of the vessel having no bulwarks. The
vessels employed by them for commercial purposes are large paduakans,
with a smaller description of prahu, short and broad, with high stems
and sterns, and covered with a roof of atap, which are engaged chiefly
in the trade with Banda and Amboyna. Maritime pursuits occupy most of
the time of the natives of these islands, and when a stoppage is put
to commerce they resort to piracy. The cost for the maintenance of the
crew is very small, these being Papuan slaves, whose food consists
chiefly of sago and a sort of periwinkle, with a little dried fish, the
latter being much esteemed by the negroes of New Guinea.

The principal branch of commerce carried on by these islanders is the
trade with Bali (an island adjoining the east end of Java), to which
are taken many of the products of the coast of New Guinea. The Raja of
Kilwari is deeply engaged in this, and frequently proceeds in person
to Bali, where the government of a village has been conferred upon
him by the king of that island, as a reward for his having purchased
and brought back to their homes some Balinese princes, who had been
captured by pirates. The Bughis traders from Celebes also resort to
the Ceram-Laut Islands, the produce of their voyages being mostly
carried to Singapore. The most important articles exported from this
group consist of slaves, nutmegs, trepang, tortoise-shell, and edible
birds'-nests, in return for which they take powder and shot, muskets,
small cannon, calicoes, China-ware, iron-work, &c. The commerce of the
entire chain of islands, extending from Ceram to New Guinea, is of
the same description. The articles exported are, for the most part,
obtained from the coast of New Guinea, which is annually resorted to by
a large number of vessels from Ceram-Laut. The natives of the various
islands forming the group assume the exclusive right of trading on
particular parts of the coast, a breach of which on the part of their
neighbours, instantly gives rise to warfare. Neither will the Papuas
carry on a trade with any but those who are in the habit of visiting
them. The places resorted to by the traders of Ceram-Laut lie to
the westward of Lakahia, a bay on the coast, situated directly north
from the Arru Islands. The extent of the trade may be imagined from
the fact, that twenty-five jonkos resort annually to Karrats-key and
Owin from Enekka, a village on Goram, alone. Several of the Ceramese
chiefs have married Papuan wives, and they have also succeeded in
converting the natives of several places on the coast to the Mohammedam
religion; but, nevertheless, the former dare not place much confidence
in them. They contrive to keep the Papuas in awe by their superior
skill in the use of arms, and this feeling is increased by the negroes
being continually at war with their neighbours, the Ceramese rather
endeavouring to promote this state of affairs than otherwise.

The monopoly of the trade on the coast is so strict, that should a
foreign trader wish to proceed there with his vessel, it would be
absolutely necessary for him to take some of the people of the islands
with him, (natives of Enekka, for example, should he wish to visit
Onion), otherwise his endeavours would be fruitless. These pilots
obtain the use of a portion of the vessel, in which to deposit their
goods, as a reward for their services, thirty piculs (about two tons)
being the usual tonnage allowed. According to the information of the
natives, an English vessel, having pilots from Enekka on board, carried
on a brisk trade with the coast in the year 1824. I heard that the
English, subsequently, suffered some punishment from the Ceramese for
this breach of their right of monopoly, but I was unable to ascertain
the particulars of this occurrence.

The English whalers occasionally visit the islands to the eastward of
Ceram, where they obtain spices and other productions in exchange for
arms, ammunition, calicoes, &c. I was assured that the Raja of Kilwari
engaged deeply in this unlawful trade.

The people of Papua-Oni and of Amalas, two places on the coast of
New Guinea directly east from Ceram-Laut, send out every year from
one hundred to one hundred and twenty small vessels on piratical
excursions, and proceed to a considerable distance from their homes.
Their mode of warfare is rude in the extreme; their weapons consisting
only of bows, arrows and spears. I have been assured, that they devour
the prisoners they take during these excursions. They entertain
considerable dread of the Ceramese, and carefully avoid doing them or
theirs any injury.

According to the information I received from some inhabitants of
Ceram-Laut, the natives of New Guinea are divided into two tribes,
mountaineers and dwellers on the coast, who are continually waging war
with each. The people occupying the sea-coast form by far the smaller
portion, but from their warlike habits they find no difficulty in
maintaining a superiority. The captives taken by the latter from the
inferior tribes are sold to the foreign traders, by whom they are held
in great esteem, so much so that their price is higher even than that
given for slaves of Bali, Lombok, or Sumbawa. The women from Koby, Ay,
and Karres, are considered the most attractive, and are often kept as
inferior wives by the Ceramese; the Raja of Kilwari, among others,
having a wife born in the Papuan village of Atti-Atti. The price given
for a slave on the coast is usually two pieces of white calico, valued
at from eight to ten Spanish dollars, from sixty to seventy rupees
(five to six pounds sterling) being obtained by the traders for them
at Bali, and other places in that direction. Natives worthy of belief
have assured me, that if a Papua of the coast is struck by a desire to
obtain any articles brought by the foreign trader, for which he has
no productions to give in exchange, he will not hesitate to barter one
or two of his children for them; and if his own are not at hand, he
will ask the loan of those of his neighbour, promising to give his own
in exchange when they come to hand, this request being rarely refused.
This appeared to me to be almost incredible, but the most trustworthy
natives were unanimous evidence to its truth. The mountaineers
themselves sometimes sell their children also. In other places, I have
known parents sell their children when their maintenance became too
heavy a burthen for them to bear, without heeding whether they would
ever see them again. Such a total absence of feeling certainly brings
these savage people below the level of dumb animals!

or oppression, are forced to leave their native country. Singapore, at
the opposite extreme of the Indian Archipelago, has already been very
beneficial in this respect, and the fact of their subjects being able
so readily to obtain the protection of the British, has forced the
native chiefs to behave towards them with more consideration.]

The islands of Great and Little Keffing are situated close to the
south-east extreme of Ceram, to which they are joined by reefs under
water. Little Keffing is well peopled, and contains several villages
enclosed by stone walls, each village being governed by an independent
Raja. The two largest are under the command of the Major of Keffing
and Raja Kelu. The island is low, and the groups of huts, shaded
and half hidden by cocoa-nut and other fruit trees, present a very
picturesque appearance. Each village possesses a _Masidiet_ or temple,
to which several priests are attached, those from Java being held in
particularly high respect. The houses of the Rajas are always larger
than the other buildings, over the top of which they are visible to
those at a distance. A short description of the residence of the Raja
of Kilwari will convey to the reader an idea of the sort of house in
which the chiefs dwell, as they all bear a considerable resemblance
to each other. On each side of the entrance to that of the Raja of
Kilwari, two pieces of cannon are planted, (these being tokens of the
important station of the owner), from which a salute was fired as I
entered. The house itself was raised four feet above the ground, and
was accessible by means of a stair, or rather a stout ladder. The
centre apartment was very dark, being only lighted by a hole in the
roof and the opening which served for a door-way, on each side of which
were chambers used as sleeping-rooms, store-rooms, and kitchens. The
earthen pans, plates, dishes, &c., used in preparing their meals, were
obtained from the Ki Islands. The rooms were floored with bamboos, or
with narrow strips of the wood of the Areka tree, separated an inch or
two from each other. Through these openings the offal is thrown, which
renders the ground under the house very dirty and unpleasant, as the
Mohammedans, unlike their heathen neighbours, keep no pigs to remove
it. The walls and partitions of the house were adorned with arms, such
as lelahs, muskets, large and well-tempered parangs, bows and arrows,
spears, &c., and over the floor were spread elephants' tusks, gongs,
and painted chests with gilt mouldings, which probably contained
clothes and valuables. We sat cross-legged on the floor in the centre
apartment, after the manner of the natives, by a number of whom, clad
in their best array, we were surrounded, while the host and his family
tendered us tea and sweatmeats. All the other apartments were closed,
and we were not requested to visit them, the wives of the Raja being
probably within them.

The brother of the Orang Kaya of Ghissa and another native, offered
to accompany me as interpreters, whose services I accepted, advancing
a portion of the salary that had been fixed on, to provide for the
maintenance of their families during their absence.

We left our anchorage on the 13th. When getting under weigh we found
that the stream-anchor had hooked a coral reef, and we had much
difficulty in weighing it. The water was so extremely clear, that we
could plainly perceive the fish darting over the sandy patches at the
bottom, although the depth was from ten to fifteen fathoms. Our course
lay to the east-south-east, and we pursued our voyage with an unsteady
westerly wind, which soon carried us into the vicinity of the Goram
Islands.

These islands, which are three in number, and are separated from the
Ceram-Laut group by a narrow channel, are distinguished among the
natives by the names of Goram, Manovolko, and Salawatta or Salavako.
The first possesses the greatest population, and the most extensive
commerce. The villages are mostly erected on the sea-coast, on spots
near which the coral reefs afford good shelter for their vessels. The
inhabitants, who accord with the Ceramese in manners and customs, are
well acquainted with the neighbouring coasts, and willingly go on board
foreign trading vessels as pilots. The people of the different villages
often make war upon each other, and their differences are rarely
settled without the interposition of our Government. Many of their
vessels are sent to Banda, Bali and Sumbawa, as well as to the coast of
New Guinea, with the natives of which they have constant communication.
The trade with the islands to the eastward of Ceram is indispensable
to our settlement of Banda, as it is entirely supplied with sago,
oil, cocoa-nuts, stock, wood, _attap_, _siri_, and other necessaries
by them. When we can succeed in preventing the direct importation to
the islands, of calicoes and other articles from Singapore, Malacca,
and even from Manilla and Bengal, the prosperity of Amboyna and Banda
would be greatly increased by the exclusive trade they would enjoy,
particularly if a Dutch ship of war were occasionally to show herself
among the group. At present, however, our settlements participate in
the trade to a much smaller extent than foreigners.

Coin is not current in this group. Gold and silver money is willingly
received by them; but when once they get it into their hands they never
pay it away again. Copper money is entirely unknown. For the purchase
of small articles it is necessary for the stranger to have hanks of
cotton twist, which is much in demand for the manufacture of thread.
This is dyed of a red colour by the Bangkudu root,[43] which gives
the thread a firm colour, at the same time increasing its strength
and durability, and is afterwards wove into a stuff much in demand at
the Ki and Arru Islands. The colours are usually dark red with cross
stripes of blue. Large quantities of this cloth are manufactured on
the Ceram and Goram Islands, the greater portion of the thread being
obtained from Bali. The broad klewangs or hangers, manufactured on
these islands, are also much in demand throughout the Archipelago of
the Moluccas; in fact, their temper is excellent, being superior even
to those made in Java. These swords are usually from two to three
feet long, and beautifully flowered after the manner of the Damascene
blades. The inhabitants rarely employ themselves in ship-building, but
obtain their smaller prahus from the Ki Islands, and the larger ones
from Bali. I have already described these vessels, and will only now
remark the simplicity of the materials with which they are fitted out.
A paduakan has only one sail, and is steered by two rudders (one on
each quarter), which can readily be raised out of the water. The two
cables, each from thirty to fifty fathoms long, are made of twisted
rattans, and the anchors are composed of hard wood, having the flukes
a little sharpened, and a large stone fastened to the stock. A small
canoe is carried on the deck. The bottom of the vessel is covered with
a composition of lime, and the top sides are painted with a black
mixture made from burnt rattans and husks of cocoa-nuts. Some pots
of fresh water, a little salt, a quantity of sago bread, and some
fishing-hooks and lines, complete their equipments.

The Goram Islands are rather high, and extremely fertile. Rice is grown
on the main island; but the inhabitants of Manovolko and Salawatta
dare not plant it, as its cultivation is considered as an exclusive
hereditary right of the people of Goram. In the interior of the islands
many fugitives from Bali and Sumbawa reside, who are forced to pay a
slavish obedience to the old inhabitants. The wants of these people are
few, and are supplied by the forests, which afford plenty of hogs and
other wild animals; even snakes, as I was informed, being esteemed a
delicacy among them.

Fishing is but little attended to here, fowls and goats, which here
abound, being preferred as food. The Papuan slaves fish with lines, but
_seroos_, or stake-traps, with which fish are caught on the banks,
are here rarely used. The women often employ themselves in catching
crabs in the shallow water, adopting rather a singular mode. They
place baskets over each foot, and walking over the mud-banks they are
enabled to feel the crabs when they tread upon them, which they secure
by thrusting a sharp-pointed stick into them through the basket. The
mode of line-fishing adopted in the Archipelago is very simple. The
lines are from sixty to one hundred fathoms long, having at the end a
piece of copper wire, four or five fathoms in length, to which the hook
is fastened. The bait consists of hen's feathers, which are tied fast
to the hook, and when in the water have the appearance of small fish.
There are several other modes adopted, which it will be unnecessary to
explain at length.

We saw no land until the 16th, when we made the Arru Islands, and
sailing close along the west coast of Wassia, hauled in, and came to an
anchor in the strait between that island and Wadia. The Orang Kaya of
Wadia immediately came on board, and in the afternoon I went on shore
to return his visit. Hoping to gain some information at Dobbo about the
coast of New Guinea, and wishing also to know how they got on there, I
proceeded there the same night with the armed boats. I there met with
the Orang Kaya of Wama, who informed me of the death of the head chief
of Wokan, which took place about a month previous, and of his office
being filled by his brother, who arrived among us during the same day.

A brig from Sourabaya, and several other vessels, lay at anchor off
the town, while thirteen paduakans from Macassar and Boni were hauled
up on the beach, the commanders of which had gone to some of the more
distant islands of the group, especially Vorkay, to purchase trepang,
mother-o'pearl-shell and tortoise-shell. Two other large paduakans lay
at anchor behind Maykor, the trade being conducted in a very regular
manner. Several differences had, however, occurred, the most important
of which were the following.

The Nakhoda, or commander of a jonko from Ghissa, complained to me
that the Raja of Amma, a village situated on the Goram Islands, having
come here to trade, had forbidden him (the Nakhoda) from disposing of
his goods, with a view to obtain a better price than his own; the Raja
being enabled to enforce his prohibition, by the aid of two armed
prahus. As no reason existed for the trade being open to one and not
to another, it became necessary for me to make known to the people of
Goram my displeasure at such arbitrary proceedings. The Raja, however,
alarmed at our arrival, had departed no one knew whither, his prahu
having been seen standing out to sea as we came in. The Orang Kaya of
Wama remarked to me, that the Raja was well aware that his conduct
would not bear the test of examination.

A second affair was as follows:--A juro-batu, or pilot (literally,
watcher for rocks), named Seyid-Ed-Din, complained to me that the
Nakhoda of a prahu from Amboyna had turned him ashore, so that he was
now without the means of subsistence. The Nakhoda had gone to the
back part of the group; but I soon learned that the juro-batu was not
entirely free from blame, and was thus prevented from coming to a
decision on the case, being only able to order the commanding officer
of the prahu to take the man back to Amboyna, as it was improper that
any of the crew should be put on shore in a foreign place.

In the year 1824, a prahu belonging to Kilwari, while on her voyage
from New Guinea to the Ki Islands, put into Wadia, having received
damage at sea from bad weather, and being in want of fresh water. The
Orang Kaya of Wadia wished to purchase the trepang which formed part of
her cargo, but the parties not being able to come to terms, the crew
of the prahu made preparations to depart. This, however, was prevented
by the Orang Kaya, who endeavoured to decoy the strangers into the
river, but being unable to succeed he boarded the vessel with several
prahus, and plundered her of some pieces of cloth, some gunpowder, and
other trifles. The Ceramese, to avoid further violence, fled the same
night, and continued their voyage to the Ki Islands. It accidentally
happened, that several of those who formed the crew of the prahu, some
of whom were relatives of my interpreter for New Guinea, were now in
a vessel at Dobbo, and came to me to request that I would obtain the
restitution of the goods which had been taken from them. The chiefs
of the different villages were present at the time, the Orang Kaya
of Wadia being among them. He did not deny the circumstance, but, as
usually occurs, laid all the blame on the villagers. I requested the
proprietors of the plundered goods to return with me to Wadia, where
I obtained the property for them, but forgave, for this time, the
villagers, threatening them with severe punishment should they ever
transgress in like manner again.

The Christian teachers of Wakan, Wama and Maykor, stated to me, that
they could remain no longer on the islands, as they were unable to
obtain even sufficient provisions for their maintenance. On examination
I found that these useful men received nothing whatever from the
villagers, so that I could not be surprised at their desire to return
to Amboyna, especially those of Wama and Maykor. I took the opportunity
of a general meeting of chiefs on the Island Wokan, to mention the
subject to those who professed Christianity. These did not deny that
the teachers had been left to their own resources; but stated in
excuse, that as M. Bik had promised the teachers a monthly salary of
ten rupees, they must have sufficient to subsist upon. I observed to
them the injustice of their conduct, on which they begged the teachers
to remain, and promised to provide for their maintenance.

Some of the teachers appeared to me as not being on the most friendly
footing with the natives, which, I believe, was owing greatly to their
presuming too much on the protection of the Government, and wishing
to be _masters_ in reality. I therefore remonstrated with them on the
impropriety of attempts at rule, and sent the teacher of Maykor back
again to his home, at the same time exhorting them to perform their
duties better for the future than they had hitherto, and give the
natives clearer ideas of Christianity. The dispositions of the Arru
Islanders are excellent, and it is truly to be regretted that their
instruction in the tenets of our religion has hitherto been so slight.
Were a missionary to be sent among them, his labours would be attended
with very good results. The distribution of some Malayan Bibles, hymn
books, and tracts, which I had received from M. Kam, gave much delight
to the Christian natives.

At the earnest request of the three teachers, I gave to each twenty
rupees (£1. 15*s.*), together with some rice and other provisions. One
of the three whom I brought with me from Amboyna, was installed at
Duryella.

On the 19th of April we departed in the boats for Wokan. The Orang
Kaya of Wadia, who had remained with me up to this time, returned to
his village to await my arrival there. On the following morning the
chiefs and elders of the Christians assembled, when Zadrak Hermans
was appointed as head chief of Wokan, with the usual ceremonies,
and received a golden-knobbed baton, together with the certificate
of appointment which had been provided for his father, to which an
appendix was attached, naming him his successor. I also delivered
certificates to the chiefs of Wama and Maykor, with which I had been
furnished by the Government. The ceremonies were concluded with an
appropriate address, and a salute of lelah shots. The people here are
not less desirous than those of most other islands of this Archipelago,
to have a Dutch garrison among them.

At noon I returned on board, accompanied by five vessels, containing
a number of my native friends, whom I entertained on board at dinner,
after which they returned home with many expressions of thanks for the
kind proofs of remembrance on the part of the Government.

On the 21st I presented the Orang Kaya of Wadia with an act of
appointment, after which I arranged the affair of piracy, of which I
have previously made mention. During our stay among the islands, the
weather had been continually calm and rainy. I was disappointed in my
expectations of receiving important information, concerning the coasts
of New Guinea. When the people heard that I intended to go there, they
expressed much satisfaction, hoping that they would be benefitted by
the results of the expedition. The Ceramese I met with here, who had
lately left the coast of New Guinea, informed me that the Papuas to the
northward of the Arru Islands had assured them, that _Orang Pati_, or
white people, dwelt further to the south-eastward of them.[44]

Having filled up our water-casks, and put the rigging in order, we
left our anchorage off Wadia on the morning of the 22nd of April, and
continued our voyage towards New Guinea. Owing to calms we were unable
to advance far during the day, but we afterwards were favoured by a
steady breeze, which soon carried us out of view of the Arru Islands.
Bartholomeus River, (on the south coast of New Guinea), being the point
to be first visited, we shaped our course for the south-west extreme
of that great island. The winds and weather we experienced during
the passage, were very unsteady, the former being generally from the
northern quarter. As soon as we passed the Arru Islands, the pilots
stated to me that they were unacquainted with the navigation beyond,
and were even afraid to proceed any farther. The traders from Ceram,
and the islands to the westward, do not penetrate beyond the Arrus.

A number of birds usually came on board the brig towards evening, to
roost, most of which appeared to me to be land-birds. The colours of
some were very beautiful, and in many we could trace a resemblance to
our small ducks, magpies and larks.

When to the north-east of the Arru Islands we obtained soundings, for
the first time, on a corally bottom; but as we stood to the south-west
the depth gradually decreased, the bottom changing from coral to sand,
and from sand to soft mud. We encountered daily an immense number of
large Noord-kapers (a species of whale), which collected around the
brig, and on two occasions one of these sea-monsters passed under her
bottom, grazing the keel, and shaking the entire vessel.

At noon, on the 26th, we passed over a small patch of hard sand, on
which we had only nine fathoms, the depth around being nineteen and
twenty fathoms mud. This, which was named Kolff Bank, was found to lie
in latitude 7 deg. south, longitude 136 deg. 4 min. east.[45]

On the night of the 27th, while steering to the south-south-east, the
depth gradually decreased, but the bottom still continued muddy. This
made me suspect that we were approaching False Cape, (or Cape Valsche),
the south-west extreme of New Guinea. On steering south the depth
increased to twenty-six fathoms, but after hauling up north-east and
east-north-east we had only five and six fathoms, which, coupled with
a swell from the south and south-east, led me to conclude that we had
passed the Cape. In the evening, when the atmosphere cleared up, we
saw the land to the northward, and soon brought up to await the day.
During the night we experienced north-east winds, with heavy rain, and
a current of six miles from the east-south-east. Rise and fall between
seven and eight feet.

As opportunity offered, we stood in and out from the shore--never
being able to approach nearer than eight miles, the depth at that
distance being only three fathoms, but further to seaward it increased
very rapidly, the first cast of the lead, when standing off the edge of
the bank, giving five fathoms. The land was everywhere low, and covered
with large trees. I endeavoured as much as possible to approach the
land, either with the brig or with the boats, but was always prevented
by the mud-bank. Between the Cape and St. Bartholomeus River, we saw no
opening that would admit our entrance.

Having arrived off the mouth of the St. Bartholomeus River, which
is easily distinguished, as the points forming the entrance are a
considerable distance apart, the unfavourable state of the weather,
coupled with an increasing swell raised by the strong south-east wind,
determined me to return towards False Cape; being the more inclined to
do so, from the brig, which was anchored nine miles from the shore,
rolling heavily, from being forced by the tide to lie across the swell,
and having already carried away several of the shrouds of the lower
rigging.

The large islands in the Indian Archipelago, generally, have a
considerable influence on the wind, causing land and sea breezes;
but here it was not the case. This circumstance was injurious to
the objects of the voyage, as we were unable to contend against the
strength of the south-east monsoon, being thus prevented from passing
farther to the eastward. To have fully examined and laid down this
part of the coast would have required more time than we could bestow
upon it. We ascertained the south extreme of the land to lie in
latitude 8 deg. 25 min. south, while the longitude of the mouth of St.
Bartholomeus River, by chronometers and lunar observations, was found
to be 139 deg. 2 min. 25 sec. east of Greenwich. I have laid down the
trending of the land in the accompanying chart as accurately as I
could, and am confident of the correctness of the positions assigned to
the principal points.

On the 3rd of May we stood back to the westward, and passed round False
Cape without having any opportunity of landing, although, being now on
a weather shore, we were able to employ the boats with more safety.
An immense number of large and small sharks always attended the brig,
many of which were caught by the ship's company. On the 7th, while
the boats were rowing as usual along the mud-bank, smoke was seen to
arise from the shore, and on nearing the spot a number of people were
seen climbing up into the trees, who fled into the forest as the boats
approached. We were here again disappointed, for the low marshy land
was fronted by an extensive mud-bank, which forbade our approach. This
bank was covered with crocodiles, which took flight on seeing the boats.

We continued running along shore until the 8th, when we entered a wide
channel, carrying a depth of six and seven fathoms close into the south
shore, while the land on the opposite side was scarcely visible. We
anchored in seven fathoms within the entrance, and the same night I
left the brig in the boats, accompanied by the surgeon, the clerk, and
the interpreters, for the purpose of ascending the river. We passed up
along the south shore, which was still low, marshy, and well-wooded,
and having ascended about twenty-eight miles we turned back towards
the brig, as I judged it inadvisable to proceed further, the continued
rain being likely to give rise to sickness among the boats' crews.
The breadth of the river throughout was about five miles, the depth
being about eight fathoms in mid-channel, and three fathoms within
half a cable's length from the shore. The tides were very regular,
the ebb appearing to be rather the stronger. Rise and fall ten feet.
The water abounded with fish, and the shores were covered with birds
bearing much resemblance to geese, white ducks, snipes, &c. No natives
were seen during the excursion, nor were any traces of them seen, with
the exception of two old canoes, formed of hollowed trees, which were
half buried in the mud. The tameness of the birds would lead to the
conclusion that they were but little acquainted with man. Only one of
the numerous small creeks we met with produced fresh water, and this
was sixteen miles from the sea. From the creek to the sea, the shore
was inaccessible on account of the mud-bank which fronted it.

This previously unknown river received the name of Dourga River. The
mouth was found to lie in lat. 7 deg. 12 min. south, long. 138 deg. 44
min. east.[46]

Having arrived on board on the 12th, we weighed and stood
west-north-west, north-west, and north, along the edge of the mud-bank;
the water was yellow and muddy, the shadows of the clouds thrown upon
it giving it the appearance of being full of reefs and banks. The
coast, which we could not approach nearer than from ten to twelve
miles, formed several bays hereabouts.

On the 13th, being between the parallels of 6 deg. and 6 deg. 30 min.
south, we were enabled to near the land, and seeing smoke arise to the
northward of us we stood towards it, and shortly perceived a number of
small houses on the sandy beach, off which we came to anchor in three
fathoms, about four miles distant from the shore. A number of men were
running to and fro on the beach, and I lowered one of the boats down
for the purpose of communicating with them. Several small prahus,
containing seven or eight men each, now came towards the vessel, and
having approached within musket-shot, turned back towards the shore.
With a view to give them confidence I sent the crew down below, and
caused the pilots and interpreters to call out to them; but their
answers were unintelligible. Seeing that they were afraid to come on
board, I sent one of the interpreters with six native seamen in the
boat, unarmed, with a view to conciliate them by presents of spirits,
tobacco, &c., which were shown to them, and then launched towards
them on a plank. Our endeavours, however, were unsuccessful; for they
were as much afraid of the boat as of the brig, and retreated on its
approach. I therefore called the boat on board again, on which the
natives remained quiet for some time, until the number of their prahus
were increased to twelve, when they suddenly rowed towards the brig
with a loud shout, stopping, however, when still at a little distance.
I again showed them the presents, and called to them in the Papuan
language, but with the same result as before. I again sent the boat
towards them, without the interpreter, being able to get near, and it
had no sooner commenced returning than the natives followed with loud
cries, taking up their bows and arrows, but stopping short when the
people in the boat ceased rowing. This mode of proceeding continued
for some time, and, at length, seeing that the natives had their bows
strung ready for attack, I fired a blank shot towards them, on which
they all threw themselves flat on their faces for a few moments, and
then paddled away for the shore with all their might.

These people appeared to be of large stature, with jet-black skins,
and curled hair. They went entirely naked, and no scarifying of the
skin, or other mode of ornamenting, was visible on their persons. In
two of the prahus I remarked several men whose skins were of a whitish
colour. They appeared to be chiefly young men, not one among them being
advanced in years. Two of the eldest-looking wore the skins of animals.

While the prahus were pulling towards shore, a man stood up in one of
them, with a thick bamboo in his hand, out of which he threw something
that appeared to me to be ashes.[47] When the boats approached them
they also threw water up in the air, and showed their teeth like
enraged dogs. My interpreter assured me that these people were so
inhuman as to devour their prisoners taken in war, which appeared
probable enough, if we may judge from the above grimaces.

The huts of these negroes, which are scattered along the beach, are low
and open on all sides, the roof being composed of palm leaves. The soil
around the village was white sand, on which many large trees grew, many
_carwarinas_ being among them. A small river ran into a bay immediately
opposite to our anchorage. On going on shore we were as unsuccessful
as on the water, in our attempts to communicate with these shy people,
as they always fled on our approach, and climbed into the trees at a
distance. To judge from the number of houses and men that we saw, the
coast hereabouts must be very populous. We saw at a distance some other
houses, which appeared to be much larger than those on the beach. Some
bones, probably those of buffaloes, were met with, but not the least
trace of agriculture, arts or civilization. I was sorry, nevertheless,
at not being able to communicate with the natives, for the next morning
I continued my voyage, it being tolerably certain that all endeavours
to make friends with them would be fruitless.

Shortly after our departure we suddenly struck soundings in two and
a half fathoms, having had from ten to fifteen fathoms immediately
before. We continued for several successive days standing along shore,
as close as we could with safety, without finding a spot in which we
could anchor within a convenient distance of the shore. During the
nights we had bad weather, the rain continually pouring down; and the
swell from the southward increasing every day.

On the 16th we saw high land for the first time, the extreme being far
in the interior, between the meridians of 137 deg. and 138 deg. east.
We remarked that several rivers here entered the sea, but so heavy a
surf prevailed everywhere that we could not approach, being repeatedly
obliged to bring up at a distance of from seven to eight miles from
the shore, owing to our coming suddenly from five to three and a half
fathoms. On the 17th, while sailing along shore, we often attempted to
stand in, but were always stopped by reefs; while at six miles off the
shore we had twenty to twenty-five fathoms. I regretted much that the
strong winds and heavy sea prevented me from examining the different
creeks which we saw, although the interpreters assured me that the
inhabitants were in a state of the utmost barbarism. On the following
day we again stood in, and obtained no bottom with the lead at a
distance of four miles off shore, the hills here running steep off into
the sea. We saw some dwellings about the meridian of 130 deg. east, but
were unable to approach them. The coast was now known to the pilot,
who assured me that he knew a spot in the neighbourhood where we might
obtain fresh water, and having stood off for the night, we endeavoured
at daylight to enter under his direction between an island and the
northern part of a deep bay. The decrease of the depth, however, soon
caused us to stand out to sea again, the pilot excusing himself by
saying, that he always entered here with prahus, and thought that there
was water enough for the brig also.

Being desirous of communicating with the people of the island, and if
possible to obtain fresh water, I again stood in towards the island,
and anchored in five fathoms west-south-west of it. We had previously
seen smoke arise from the shore, which our interpreters stated to be
a signal of welcome, which induced me, after anchoring, to send the
boat on shore with the interpreters, for the purpose of bringing some
of the natives on board the brig. In the afternoon the boat returned
with three of the chiefs, who at first appeared afraid; but after I had
given them some rice and arrack they became more at their ease. The
Raja, an aged man, danced, sang, and made a number of curious gestures.
He could not speak Malayan, but with the aid of the interpreters
we were enabled to converse in their own language. As a proof of
friendship I gave the old Raja a _kabya_ and a handkerchief for the
head, distributing presents of the same description among the others,
with a promise of more if they would come on board the next day.

I informed them, that the only object of my visit to these parts was
to offer the friendship of the Dutch Government to the natives, and
at the same time to afford protection to the traders who frequent
the neighbourhood. They shouted in praise of the Company and of the
Ceramese, especially the Raja of Kilwari; and, on the other hand,
expressed their detestation of the Chinese, the Bughis, and the
Macassars. On my enquiry whether any of the last-mentioned people were
in the habit of visiting them, they answered that they were not, but
that they gained much information concerning them from the Ceramese.[48]

I mentioned to the Raja and his friends, that I should send the boats
on shore next morning to obtain water, and that our men, as usual,
would be armed, which they must not suppose to arise from any want
of confidence. I also stated my intention of visiting their village
in person towards noon, at which they expressed much satisfaction,
and taking leave, with a hearty shake of the hand, promised that the
villagers should employ themselves in fishing, and send the greater
part of the produce on board the brig. At seven o'clock the boat
carried them ashore, after they had received a parting present of
arrack and tobacco.

NEW GUINEA.

Armed Boats sent on Shore.--Treacherous Attack of the Natives.--A
Soldier killed.--Cowardly Conduct of the Officers in Charge of the
Watering-Party.--The Author personally visits the Bay.--Causes of
the Barbarism of the Natives of New Guinea.--Faithless and arbitrary
Conduct of the Ceramese.--Profitable Nature of the Trade.--Departure
from New Guinea.

The friendly meeting with the chiefs, coupled with the assurances of
the interpreters, who had been in the habit of making yearly visits
to the coast, determined me to obtain here a supply of water, this
necessary of life having become scarce on board. On the morning of the
20th, therefore, I caused the empty casks to be put into the tender,
which was armed with a one-pounder gun, and manned with an European
warrant-officer and a seaman, eighteen rowers, and a corporal with six
soldiers. The chief command was given to a midshipman, who, with six
European and four native seamen, went in the jolly-boat in company with
the tender.

The command of the armed party, who were to cover the waterers, was
entrusted to the corporal, who had been highly recommended to me at
Amboyna, and to whom I gave a written order to guide his proceedings.
As I wished to superintend the watering in person, and also to visit
the village, I caused another of the boats to be lowered, and sent, in
the first place, to examine the depth of water to the north-east and
north-west, the result proving the impossibility of approaching nearer
to the land with the brig. An affection in the chest, with which I had
been afflicted since my voyage to the Bay of Boni, being more than
usually troublesome in the morning, forced me, however, to defer my
visit to the afternoon.

About noon, hearing guns fired on shore, I sent an officer with an
armed boat to enquire the cause, furnishing them with ammunition
for the tender. When close to the island he encountered the boats
returning, and remarked that great disorder prevailed among their
crews, three of the number being badly wounded. They stated that all
their cartridges being wet, and some of the soldiers having thrown away
their arms, they had nothing remaining with which they could defend
themselves. Although the officer sent to their assistance had with him
a dozen good muskets, and cartridges both for them and for the small
cannon, he thought it best to return on board, which I did not regret
when I heard of the events that had occurred. It appeared that our
people met with a friendly reception from the Papuas, who showed them
the watering-place, while those who had visited the brig the previous
night brought them presents of cocoa-nuts and _sagoweer_, or palm wine.
On his first arrival the midshipman made arrangements according to his
instructions, and had scarcely finished filling his casks in readiness
to be put on board the tender, when the natives suddenly attacked our
party with a shower of spears and arrows. The Javanese seamen, who had
been stupid enough to leave their arms behind them, immediately left
the water casks, and fled towards the tender, while the corporal, who
should have been the last to retreat, left his post at the first shout
of the Papuas, and throwing away his musket and sword, followed their
example. The Javanese Mandor,[49] however, took up the musket and
fired it at the attackers. The shameful flight of the corporal created
great confusion among the covering party, to whom the former cried out
that they were to follow him, which they did, after making a short
stand. The Papuas naturally acquired fresh courage on seeing this, and
fell on the hindmost, whom they could easily wound as they fled, while
little opposition could be made on our side, as the tender had already
shoved off, and the muskets of the people in the boat had become
useless from their being wetted as their owners waded on board.

The soldiers and seamen made heavy complaints against the corporal,
to whose cowardice the unfortunate result of the affair was to be
attributed, he having caused the greatest confusion by cutting the
grapnel rope of the tender, and shoving her off. Concerning the conduct
of the midshipman I would rather be silent. On subsequent examination I
discovered, alas! that my orders had not been followed, and that some
had thought more of amusing themselves than of executing the duty on
which they had been sent.

At the commencement of the attack, H. Smit, a seaman who was sentry at
the well, was wounded by two spears, and Ziengo, a soldier, who had
stoutly maintained his post, was dreadfully injured, being pierced
with no less than two-and-twenty wounds; while another of the seamen,
Van Grieken, was wounded slightly by an arrow in the shin-bone. The
courageous Ziengo died immediately after his arrival on board, while
under the hands of the doctor.

Several small casks, a couple of muskets, some cartridge-boxes, and
a quantity of clothing, having been left on shore, I determined to
send the tender (into which a carronade had now been placed) and an
armed boat to bring them off, and to efface the shame which our people
had brought upon them. Being still too unwell to leave the brig, I
entrusted the command of the boats to one of the officers, with orders
to obtain the last articles if possible; but should circumstances
render this unadvisable, he was to keep the natives in check during the
night, and await my arrival in the morning with additional force. A
strong easterly wind, accompanied by heavy showers of rain, prevented
them, however, from reaching the island; and at daylight the signal
for their return to the brig was made, and they came alongside. The
carronade was now taken out of the tender, and two one-pounder guns
placed on board her in its stead, when we stood towards the island,
the tender and the boat carrying in all thirty men. We soon reached
the shore, when the spot on which the encounter had taken place was
pointed out to me. I landed with a portion of the men, and reached the
thick forest that bounded the path to the well, this being about a
pistol-shot distant from the beach. Every thing that our party left on
shore was found, but several of the casks were in pieces. Much blood
was seen scattered about, especially near the well, where the natives
had probably washed their wounds.

From the information I could collect concerning this unfortunate
occurrence, it appeared that the Papuas, who were probably unacquainted
with the deadly effect of our weapons, attacked our people in great
numbers when the latter were off their guard, and probably without
arms.[50] Several shots were fired at them from the muskets, and from
the one-pounder loaded with grape-shot, which must have done great
execution. The courageous Javanese Mandor, who had remained ashore
with the jolly-boat for some time after the midshipman had retreated
with the tender, in order to bring off the wounded men, had kept up a
constant fire at the natives with two muskets, and declared that he had
seen three fall, who were carried into the forest by their companions.
The unfortunate soldier, Ziengo, had been set upon by a number at
once, and had received the most deadly of his numerous wounds from an
axe that had been thrown away by some of our party. The natives would
not have left him but for the continued fire from the jolly-boat.
Notwithstanding the superior numbers of the natives, our people would
never have been routed had they been on their guard. Unfortunately, my
orders were not followed, and they separated from each other, thinking
more of amusing themselves by bathing and walking, than of preparing
against attack, which gave the natives an opportunity of falling upon
them unawares, and had the latter known how to avail themselves of the
confusion they had created, our loss must have been much greater than
it was. The conduct of my countrymen grieved me deeply.

At the watering-place we could find no traces of people having been
there since the previous night. The arms that had been thrown away,
and the clothes left by the bathers, remained untouched. The ground,
from the beach to the forest, was strewed with arrows and spears, among
which were two intended for striking fish; these were provided with
iron points, but the others were merely bamboos, the ends of which had
been pointed and hardened in the fire. The arrows had wooden points and
barbs; the bows, by which they were discharged, being formed merely
of a bamboo-stick with a string of rattan. The force with which these
arrows were shot was so small, that even from a short distance they
scarcely did more than penetrate the clothes of our people, many of
whom found the wooden points of the arrows sticking in their garments
after the affair was over.

As the cocoa-nut trees are not numerous on the coast, while their
produce forms an indispensable article of subsistence, I caused those
scattered along the coast to be cut down, partly to show that we had
not been driven away by fear, and partly to deter them from committing
similar misdeeds in future. The interpreters assured me this would be
a severe chastisement, and that they were in the habit of killing the
relatives of those who injured the cocoa-nut trees.

We now went further into the bay to Kayu Merah, and pulled down some
huts we found standing at the bottom of the heights, immediately
behind the island. Men were occasionally seen, who took flight on
our approach, and climbed into the trees, the better to observe our
motions. Having rowed round the bay without meeting with any occurrence
we turned towards the brig, on which a number of the natives made their
appearance on the beach, who took flight, however, when we turned the
boats' heads to the shore.

The treacherous conduct of the Ceramese cannot be sufficiently
reprehended. It was related to me, and I afterwards had evidence of
its truth, that these people, on their arrival with their prahus
at New Guinea, endeavoured to pick a quarrel with the natives. If
the Ceramese Raja has two or three men killed, it will be of little
consequence, as they will probably be Papua slaves, and even if the
natives take and plunder one of his vessels the loss will still be
trifling. The Raja will be rejoiced at having an excuse for chastising
the natives, and will not only attack and plunder the village, but also
catch as many of the inhabitants as he can, whom he will carry away,
under the plea of taking satisfaction for the injury that has been done
to his people. Similar transactions occur but too often.

Be this as it may, it grieved me deeply to meet with so unfavourable a
reception, as I had so anxiously wished to bring these people under our
Government, and to show them, by the distribution of presents, that we
entertained none but the most peaceable and friendly intentions towards
them. Their barbarism is mainly to be attributed to the sinister
dealings of the Ceramese, who, to retain their exclusive trade with
the coast, inspire them with hatred and aversion to all foreigners
but themselves. Until the rapacious and inhuman people of Kilwari,
Keffing, and the Goram Islands are stopped in their arbitrary career,
and are taught in an impressive manner to pay a proper respect to
the Dutch Government, the coast of New Guinea will never be available
to us for commercial purposes. Traders would gladly visit these parts
could they do so with safety, for the productions, as massoy-bark,
nutmegs, trepang, tortoise-shell, pearls, edible birds'-nests, birds
of paradise, and other articles of value, would support an important
commerce. The quantity of these rich productions purchased by the
Ceramese on the coast for an almost nominal price, and carried by them
to Bali and Singapore, is incredible. It may appear surprising that
under these circumstances the Ceramese are not in a more flourishing
state, but it must be taken into consideration that a restless people,
constantly at war, do not hoard their riches, but squander it in
leading a luxurious life. I have often been assured that traders, who
have left their homes with a valuable cargo, have returned without
sufficient property to pay their men, the whole having been lost by
gambling, or similar modes of getting rid of wealth.

The people of Kilwari visit the bay of Lakahia regularly once or twice
a year, with coarse white calico, arrack, tobacco, iron ware, &c., to
give in exchange for the productions of the country. The natives of
this part of the coast bear much resemblance in stature and complexion
to those of the easternmost of the Arrus. According to the account of
the interpreters they lead a wild and idle life.

The east monsoon now drawing to a close rendered it inadvisable to
trace the coast to the westward, which should be examined during the
other season; for the coast lies open to the southerly winds, while the
steep nature of the shore affords but insecure anchorage. My opinions
on this point were confirmed by those of intelligent natives.

As one of the principal objects of the present expedition was to visit
the Tenimber Islands, so important to the native trade, during the
return voyage, (while, were I to remain longer on the coast of New
Guinea, this could not be effected,) I determined to take my departure,
being encouraged in my decision by having already fulfilled, to the
best of my power, the instructions furnished me by the Government, and
at the same time being convinced that the coast to the eastward of the
spot where we found ourselves was not visited by foreign traders.

Islands.--Arrival at Amboyna.--Approval of our Proceedings by the
Government.--Conclusion.

We now left the inhospitable country of New Guinea, and steered to
the southward, passing near the Ki Islands. This group is composed of
several large and high islands, thinly peopled in comparison with those
around. Ki-Ili, on the east side of the Great Ki, is occupied by a
number of natives professing the Mohammedan religion, who carry on a
brisk trade with the people of the Arru Islands. Among the inhabitants
of the group are many fugitives from Banda and Ceram, who reside in the
same villages with the natives of the country. The principal islands
are called Great Ki, Little Ki, and Ki Watela. Dula, a village situated
in a bay on the west side of the Little Ki, is the chief resort of
the traders, several paduakans arriving there annually from Macassar,
while there is also considerable commercial intercourse carried on
with Banda. The people of Dula employ much of their time in building
vessels, remarkable for their strength and superiority of build, which
are in great demand at Banda, Ceram, and other places in this part of
the Archipelago, being esteemed not only for the durability of the
timber used in their construction, but also for the cheap rate at which
they can be purchased.

Ili is famous for its potteries, most of the adjacent islands deriving
their supply of earthen-ware from this and the neighbouring villages.

In their dispositions the natives of the Ki Islands are more mild and
peaceable than the generality of their neighbours. They claim certain
rights over vessels which may be stranded on their shores, and assume
some other privileges not remarkable for their justness; but this is
rather to be attributed to the system having been long established,
than to any inherent propensities to extortion.

During our voyage to the Tenimber Islands we encountered heavy
south-east winds, the monsoon being much stronger, and the rains
heavier this year, than is usually the case. I heard the same remark
made at every place I visited.

On the 26th of May we anchored close under the beautiful coast of
Vordate, between the reef running from the south-west extreme of the
island and the village of Sebeano, this anchorage being better than
the one we had taken up the previous year, which was close under the
above-mentioned reef. Immediately on our arrival the Dutch flag was
hoisted in the villages, and the chiefs came on board with a number
of prahus to welcome us back to their island, this affording a proof
of the good results attending my previous voyage, which was confirmed
on my visiting the shore, and finding that they now lived in perfect
amity with one another. The natives came on board daily, and in such
numbers, that it soon became troublesome. They are so much in the habit
of visiting with perfect freedom the trading vessels which resort to
their shores, that they considered themselves justified in doing the
same with us, it being often a matter of difficulty to keep them out of
the brig.

After our departure from these islands the preceding year, a number of
the natives had set out on a trading voyage to the islands lying to
the westward, maritime pursuits forming their favourite occupation.
They were everywhere received with friendship, and having obtained
profitable returns for their cargoes, they returned home, impressed
with thankfulness towards our Government for having established peace
among the islands, and rendered them safe for traders. According
to their information, the natives of Moa, Lette, Damma, Luan, and
the other islands, were zealously employed in erecting new _kota
companias_, or block-houses, for our residents, hoping that they would
soon have Dutch garrisons among them, while the Christian teachers were
supplied with necessaries in a most liberal manner. This news gave me
the greatest satisfaction, as it proved in the strongest manner that
my previous labours had not been fruitless. I afterwards found that
many trading vessels from these islands, even from some which had had
no communication for years, had visited Banda and Amboyna, causing
a remarkable increase in the sale of European manufactures at those
places, so that soon a most prosperous trade, coupled with increasing
prosperity to the natives, will be the result of the good measures of
our Government.

A number of prahus from Kilwari and Kinaos, had taken their station
among the islands and banks fronting the west coast of Timor-Laut, to
lie in wait for and plunder the traders of the Tenimber Islands as
they returned from their commercial voyage to the westward, and had
succeeded in mastering two jonkos, the crews of which escaped on shore
after losing some of their number. The Ceramese then plundered and
burnt their prizes. The Tenimber islanders were extremely indignant at
this act of the Ceramese, and made a sad complaint to me, thinking that
our Government was already acquainted with the affair, as the Ceramese,
when attacking them, called out that they were empowered to act as they
did by the Company, and that the Tenimber Islanders should not fire at
the Dutch flags which their opponents had received from the Government.
It cost me much trouble to convince them that the Dutch took no part
in this shameful transaction; but at length I succeeded by promising
that the Government should certainly obtain compensation from the
Ceramese for their losses.

The banks and islands to the westward of Timor-Laut are annually
visited by Ceramese jonkos, for the purpose of fishing for trepang
and tortoise-shell, or picking up any booty that may fall in their
way. Several years previously some of these had been bold enough to
approach the coast of Vordate during the night, and capture a small
fishing prahu with two men, inhabitants of Sebeano. The pirates, who
were subjects of the Raja, carried off the men to sell as slaves, but
they were fortunate enough to make their escape and return home. They
personally related to me this occurrence, and informed me of many
other misdeeds on the part of the Ceramese, an account of which I
subsequently gave to the Government.

Some time after my return to Amboyna, the Raja of Kilwari was summoned
there, and did not deny that his subjects had committed this, and other
deeds of the same description, on which he was obliged to pay a fine
of, I believe, three hundred guilders (£25) to the Tenimber Islanders.
The Raja of Kinaos was also amerced for the same transaction.

As one of the chief objects of our voyage was to visit the Island of
Serra, we made preparations, soon after our arrival at Vordate, for our
expedition thither.

It appeared to me to be impossible for the people of Vordate to
perform the promise they had made me, of redeeming the two English
youths who were held in captivity by the inhabitants of Luora, on the
east coast of Timor-Laut, since they were not in the habit of holding
communication with them. They assured me, however, that they had been
to Luora, and had found that the inhabitants would not give up their
captives unless an extravagant ransom were paid for them, as they
wished to marry them to their daughters, that their descendants might
boast of having European blood in their veins as well as the people
of Vordate, Larrat and Serra, these holding themselves as being in
some manner connected with Europeans, from their forefathers having
been distinguished as "_Anak Compania_," or Children of the Company.
The Orang Kaya, who was the only chief that visited Timor-Laut during
this year, informed me that he had seen the youths, and had offered
a considerable ransom for them without success. During the westerly
monsoon, or the period of the changes, Luora may be visited with
facility; but at the present time, when the sea breaks against the
shore in a terrible manner, such an expedition was not to be thought
of for a moment. The natives themselves appeared anxious that the
Government would send some one thither.

On the 29th, having hired the Orang Tua David to accompany us as
interpreter, we embarked on board the tender and the small boats, and
left the brig on our expedition to Serra. Towards evening we arrived
at Larrat, where we met with a tope,[51] which had arrived from Banda
during the month of April, and was about returning there with a full
cargo. The crew complained of the high price of the trepang, but in
every other respect were perfectly contented with the result of their
commercial transactions. The disturbances which had taken place at
Serra had been instrumental in decreasing the supply of trepang and
tortoise-shell, as none was now brought from that island. The goods
belonging to the tope lay in an open boat-house, which was daily
visited by numbers of the natives, without the owner having the least
fear of losing a single article, the mutual confidence with which the
trade is carried on being so great, that the trader allows a native
to take away what goods he pleases, merely mentioning the amount of
produce that is expected in return, and although the former may have no
personal knowledge of the native to whom he has delivered the goods,
he never fears that the contract will not be fulfilled. The native
immediately commences collecting produce, and never rests until he has
made full payment. It is singular that the natives never keep a supply
of trepang in hand, and only commence fishing for it when they have
received payment in advance.

The Orang Kaya and several of the other chiefs came to pay me a visit,
and complained sadly of the conduct of the Ceramese, and of the state
of affairs at Serra, which they had in vain endeavoured to reduce
to order. They appeared to be much pleased at my intention to visit
that island. As the Orang Tua David was not well acquainted with the
navigation, I requested the chiefs to hire me a prahu, promising to
make them a just remuneration for its services.

The Orang Kaya Kirimassa, and six men, having prepared themselves
to attend me with the prahu, I left Larrat the same night. Although
the tender carried only two one-pounder guns, with ammunition and
provisions, she sailed and rowed so slowly that we did not reach
Warrata, a village on the north-west end of Serra, until the 1st of
June. This island, with its inhabitants, bear so great a resemblance
to Larrat, that it will be unnecessary to enter into a particular
description of either.

The reefs which front the shore are dry at low water some distance to
seaward, it being then only possible to approach the island through
the gaps in the reef. The villages are situated near each other, while
the remainder of the island is laid out in plantations of yams and
cocoa-nut trees. The inhabitants obtain their supply of rice from the
people of Vordate, or from the foreign traders. This product forms an
extensive article of importation into these countries, as the nature
of the soil prevents its being grown in sufficient quantities for the
supply of the islanders.

The inhabitants of Serra received us in a most friendly manner, and
I immediately commenced making enquiries as to the nature of the
disturbance that had taken place. It appeared, that on the return of
the chiefs from their visit to me the preceding year with the presents
I had made them, a festival was got up to celebrate the event. A
considerable quantity of spirits was disposed of on this occasion, and
it necessarily occurred that many of the guests became very drunk,
and abused one another without mercy. The Orang Kayas Linum, Siwa,
and Kitta-Kitta, grossly insulted the Orang Kayas Leeman and Kawa,
which greatly grieved the latter and their adherents. From words they
soon came to blows, when the two chiefs who had been insulted left
their villages, and established themselves with their families on the
west coast of the island. The adherents of both parties subsequently
encountered one another on several occasions, many being killed and
wounded on both sides. Envoys from the other islands endeavoured in
vain to establish peace: the offending party wished much to make up
the affair, but the others, who had abundance of provisions, were
indifferent about the matter. On my arrival, the latter demanded an
apology from the Orang Kayas Kitta-Kitta and Linum, with the pay of
the warriors whom they had hired, stating, that in the event of these
being fulfilled, they were ready to make peace and obey the orders of
the Company.

I was received with equal friendship by both parties, and their arms
were laid aside at my request, while arrangements were made for a
meeting to decide on the terms of peace. The adherents of the offended
party had forsaken their village, and encamped about half an hour's
journey to the westward, where they had fortified their position with
palisades, watch-houses being erected in the trees round about, and
garrisoned by armed men. The mode in which the meeting was conducted
resembled that of the former ones which had taken place among the
islands, yet as it will contribute to display the character of the
natives, I will give a slight sketch of the affair.

The spot fixed on by me for the meeting was midway between the abodes
of the contending parties, and having sent forward a guard of our men,
I proceeded there myself, where I was in a manner almost stormed by
weeping women. The offending chiefs came, with the greatest humility,
unattended by any followers, while the other party advanced with
a proud bearing, fully armed, and accompanied by their national
war-music. These were clad in their best array, and certainly made
a fine warlike appearance. Some were ornamented with golden chains,
others with serpents (the thickness of the little finger) formed of
the same metal, while all were provided with golden ear-rings. Many
of the warriors had also golden bracelets on their arms, which added
considerably to the splendour of their equipment. Two of the wives of
the chiefs, dressed in handsome chintz _kabyas_, were also adorned
in a similar manner. When the two parties had approached near each
other, they stopped short, and performed their usual war-dance in a
fierce and hostile manner, after which I placed the hands of the two
principal opposing chiefs together, who immediately fell weeping upon
each other's necks, their example being followed by the others, who
embraced with tears and sobs of repentance and reconciliation, the
whole forming a scene which made a strong impression even on my hardy
seamen. Some time elapsed before they partook of the _siri_, when all
traces of enmity vanished, and all was forgotten and forgiven. I had,
certainly, never seen a more striking proof of feeling on the part of
these people.

The disturbances that had taken place were stated as the reason why the
men, who had killed our seaman at Maktia, had not been obtained, nor
the two English youths at Luora set at liberty. They promised to use
their united endeavours to effect these, and to send a report of the
event to Banda.

One evening, when several small vessels were lying around our boats, a
number of birds flew suddenly off the land, and settled, some in the
boats, and some in the water around. They proved to be quails, bearing
a perfect resemblance in every respect to those of Europe. I succeeded
in carrying five of these to Banda, without supplying them with any
other food than rice, where I had the satisfaction of presenting them
to Surgeon-Major Lengacker.

Serra does not produce so much stock as the other islands. The
natives often employ themselves in catching fish, which abound in the
adjacent waters. Hooks and lines are chiefly used. The trepang and
tortoise-shell obtained here is of a very superior quality, and is much
sought for by the traders from Amboyna and Banda.

I continued busily employed with my official duties until the 3rd of
June, when I left Serra, and commenced my return to the brig. Our
journey was much delayed by unfavourable winds, and we were daily
obliged to rest on the islands which lay in our course, the tender
rowing very heavily, while it was impossible to use the sail. The
native vessels that left with us were soon far a-head, as they rowed
with great swiftness, and could pass over the banks with facility.

Shortly after our departure we put into Maktia, where we found the
village to be in a state of utter decay. The houses were all in ruins,
everything bearing evidence to the village having been long abandoned,
while not a man could be seen around.

Every voyager in the eastern seas should be provided with plenty of
fishing tackle, which will not only be of great service, but will also
afford means of passing away time; for, I believe, that throughout the
world no seas will be found that yield such innumerable quantities of
all sorts of fish as these. With a single line sufficient fish may be
caught in a few minutes to afford a dainty meal. The drag-net, which
was used by the seamen whenever we landed on the islands, was also
found very useful, this mode of fishing being as successful as the
other. Turtle's eggs were so abundant, that the men with the assistance
of the natives, often brought them on board by basket's full. These
eggs are about the size of a billiard-ball, round, and covered with a
white, chalky film in lieu of shell. The interior is similar to that of
a hen's egg, to which they were preferred by many of our party. When
boiled, the yolk becomes firm, but the white remains soft and watery,
this being thrown aside when the egg is eaten. Six nests full of
turtles' eggs were found by us upon a sandy island near Laboba. It is
very difficult to discover the spots in which the eggs are deposited,
and requires a practised eye: the natives are very skilful in this.
When the turtle wishes to deposit her eggs, she goes on shore, on the
sandy beach, and selects a spot amid the grass, where, with her hind
feet, she makes a hole about a foot and a half deep, and having laid
from eighty to a hundred eggs, covers them carefully up, and makes a
fresh nest in some other spot. When the traces of the turtle are met
with, they are followed up until a space is found where the traces
are extinct, and here the nest will probably be met with. A stick
is thrust into the ground to find the position of the eggs, which is
often a matter of difficulty, as the ground is generally turned up
within a circumference of ten to fifteen paces. The young are brought
forth without the assistance of the parent, after the eggs have lain
under ground about three months, when the young ones crawl out of the
sand and make towards the water, which they are often prevented from
reaching by the birds of prey that lie in wait for them. The turtle are
in the habit of assembling on the beach during moon-light nights, when
they are taken with great facility. The natives usually let the female
go again, and are also averse to striking them with a harpoon, being
influenced by some superstitious feeling. They also requested that we
would not disturb the hawk's-bill turtle,[52] which we found sleeping
on the water, but willingly caught the others for us themselves.

On one of the islands at which we stopped, a large hawk's-bill turtle
was found dead in the forest. The shell was two feet and a quarter in
diameter, and yielded a head[53] weighing a pound and a half.

On one of the dry sand-banks we met with a quantity of sea-mews' eggs,
deposited in nests on the shelly sand, very close to one another, each
containing only two eggs. Numbers of the birds hovered about the bank,
their presence having first attracted our attention to the spot.

While we were at anchor under the coast of Timor-Laut one night, we
heard the lowing of a number of wild cattle, and in the morning saw the
traces of them along the sandy beach. The wild cattle, with which the
island abounds, are black, and have upright horns, their size being
about the same as that of two-year-old cattle in Holland. The natives
catch them with nooses of rattan, and also shoot them with arrows.
Wild hogs are also to be met with in abundance. Monkeys do not exist
on the island, and it is a singular thing that throughout the Moluccan
Archipelago they are only to be found on the island of Batchian, near
the south end of Gilolo.

Showers of rain, and strong unfavourable winds, rendered our return
voyage tedious and disagreeable, and we did not reach Larrat until the
9th of June. On our arrival we hauled up the tender and the boat on
the beach, to clean their bottoms, which had become very necessary. I
continued here until the 11th, busily employed with my official duties,
when I returned to the brig, accompanied by several of the chiefs.

I had given permission to one of my interpreters to take on board
a quantity of tortoise-shell and trepang, to purchase which he had
brought from Banda a quantity of goods suited to the taste of the
natives. I had thus an opportunity of witnessing closely the manner
in which the trade is conducted. He purchased a picul (133lbs.
avoirdupoise) of trepang, for goods of the value of twenty-two guilders
(£1. 17*s.*) These consisted of two Javanese dresses, two pieces of
lining chintz, two red _karwasses_, two parangs or chopping-knives, two
bush-knives, two plates, two combs, two handkerchiefs for the head, and
two catties (two pounds and a half) of copper wire. According to an
old custom, the articles they receive for their produce must always be
in pairs, except they consist of valuables, such as gold, elephants'
tusks, &c., which are valued and paid for accordingly.

The natives of the Tenimber Islands are extremely anxious to obtain
gold coin, especially ducats, and give their trepang and tortoise-shell
more readily in exchange for these than anything else. Both this and
silver coin they work up into clumsy ear-rings, bracelets, and other
ornaments, losing a considerable quantity of the metal in melting it
down. It is extremely difficult to obtain these ornaments from them.

I continued constantly employed among the islands, especially at
Vordate, until the 15th of June, when we sailed for Banda, carrying
with us favourable winds and weather. We passed, during our voyage,
near to Bird Island, an uninhabited spot, on which considerable
quantities of sulphur are collected, and carried to Bali and other
places, where it is employed in the manufacture of native gunpowder.

At Banda I put my interpreters on shore, and continued my voyage to
Amboyna, where I arrived on the 26th of June, much rejoiced at the
successful result of the expedition, of which I had soon a satisfactory
proof, in a Government Resolution of the following import:--

"_Extract from the Register of Transactions and Resolutions of the
Governor of the Moluccas._

"Friday, July 14, 1826.

"A communication from the Naval Captain, Commandant of Division, was
read (d. d. N. 104), containing the account of the voyage lately
performed by H.M. brig _Dourga_, under the command of Lieut. Kolff,
of the First Class, in the Banda Sea, and to the coast of New Guinea,
according to the instructions given him by a Resolution of the
24th March (1.1. No. 1). It appearing from the narrative, that the
above-named officer has fulfilled those instructions to as great an
extent as lay in his power, and has spared no pains to acquire the
information he was requested to collect, or to effect the duties with
the execution of which he was charged:--

"Approved of and understood--

"That M. Kolff, Lieutenant in the Navy of the First Class, receives
the thanks of the Government for the laudable manner in which he
has executed the commission entrusted to him; and that a report of
this, and of the above voyage itself, be sent to His Excellency the
Governor-General.

"An extract of this to be forwarded to Lieut. Kolff for his
information and direction.

"Copy from the above-named Register.

"Signed (W.G.) Paape,

And now, kind and honoured Reader, the task which I promised to
undertake for you is fulfilled, and may the artless narrative of a
seaman, containing not unimportant contributions to a knowledge of
countries seldom visited or described, be acceptable to you. The
countries visited by me are, as Dutch possessions, of the highest
importance to every Netherlander, while, at the same time, the simple
description of the habits and disposition of their inhabitants
may afford matter for speculation. If, by the composition of this
narrative, I have rendered myself serviceable to the reading world, or
contributed to afford entertainment, then shall I be most amply repaid
for the time employed in its compilation.--Farewell!

THE EAST INDIA VOYAGER.

By EMMA ROBERTS.

_The Publishers of this Work, with a view to render it as complete
as possible, have added the Regulations established by the Court of
Directors for appointments to the East India Company's Service. The_
"East India Voyager," _whether proceeding in a_ Civil, Ecclesiastical,
Military, Medical or Marine Capacity, _will, on reference to this Work,
acquire all the preliminary information connected with his appointment,
and which, derived from Authentic Sources, is now, through a popular
medium made extensively available_.

"Miss Roberts's talents for observation have a wide and useful field
in this publication, for which every European destined for India
owes her deep gratitude. There is hardly a possible circumstance of
which it does not treat, in a manner likely to be most advantageous
to those who consult it: and on many subjects of vital consequence
to the individual, there is such sound and sage advice, that it must
indeed be well for those who will take the trouble to think upon and
be guided by it. Need we add that it is a volume for all Indians to
possess as a friend and counsel."--_Literary Gazette_, Aug. 3.

"The manner of the _East India Voyager_, is as agreeable as its matter
is curiously instructive. To the general reader, many of the facts
will seem minute, but looking at the persons for whom the volume is
primarily designed, this is a necessity and a merit."--_Spectator_,
Aug. 3.

"Miss Roberts has in the present work given much useful and valuable
information to those journeying to India. It may, indeed, be called a
_vade mecum_ replete with knowledge. From the outfit of the cadet to
that of the lady's _boudoir_, all is treated upon; the best route, the
least expensive mode of travelling, the reader is made acquainted with
in this volume. In one word, we can recommend it to all persons about
proceeding to the East, as being the best practical guide that has
hitherto been produced."--_Sunday Times_, Aug. 4, 1839.

THE RHINE,

LEGENDS, TRADITIONS, HISTORY.

In 2 vols. 8vo. with numerous Illustrations in Wood and Zincography.

BY JOSEPH SNOWE, ESQ.

"To those whose occupations have hitherto prevented from visiting
these fairy regions, the book before us offers the best possible
compensation; its pages present the real as well as the imaginary
History of the German Stream."--_Literary Gazette._

"It will rank among the Classic Literature of the country; it deserves
to be considered as a worthy companion to the Arabian Nights, and like
that entertaining work, the pervading object of every legend is the
cultivation of virtue."--_Observer._

"This work has also the merit of drawing a clear and marked
distinction between the Historical and the nicely Superstitious
Traditions."--_The Sun._

"It was reserved for Mr. Snowe to produce the most complete work on
the 'Father of Rivers,' to heighten the charm of description in which
Mr. Snowe is so successful. The Pictorial Illustrations are numerous
and well executed."--_Morning Herald._

"J. Snowe is a writer of great power, he is a good Story Teller, and
the readers will find an infinity of amusement."--_John Bull._

"This is one of the most attractive volumes which has issued from the
press this season."--_United Service Gazette._

"We must impress our readers again with the fact that these volumes
are pleasingly descriptive, as well as abounding in Entertaining
Fiction, and we cannot too strongly recommend them to the Tourist. We
have not met with a traveller's work throughout the season that has
pleased us so much."--_Sunday Times._
