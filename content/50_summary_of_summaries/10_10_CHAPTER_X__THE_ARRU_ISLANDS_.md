Here is a summary of Chapter X. The Arru Islands:

The chapter begins with the author's voyage to the Arru Islands, where the Dutch previously had a colonial presence but had largely withdrawn in recent decades. Upon arrival, the author is struck by the unusual whitish appearance of the surrounding sea, which he attributes to the strength of the winds and currents.

The author then provides a detailed description of the Arafura people, the indigenous inhabitants of the Arru Islands. He notes their simple lifestyle, with fishing, hunting, and basic agriculture as their main subsistence activities. The Arafuras live in villages under the leadership of their elders, exhibiting a social structure and harmony that the author finds remarkable given their lack of formal religion or government.

The author is intrigued by the Arafuras' indifference to the concept of a supreme deity and their unusual funeral customs, in which the deceased's body is left to decompose in the open. He sees this as a testament to their uncivilized state, though he also expresses admiration for their ability to maintain social order without formal institutions.

Overall, the chapter paints a vivid portrait of the Arru Islanders and their traditional way of life, which the author sees as both intriguing and indicative of the challenges the Dutch face in reintegrating these remote populations into their colonial framework.
