Here is a summary of Chapter XVIII: Goram and the Arru Islands:

This chapter provides more details about the author's time in the Goram Islands and his return visit to the Arru Islands.

In Goram, he describes the different islands in the group like Manovolko and Salawatta. He notes their agricultural production, lack of major settlements, and dispersed populations including refugees from conflicts elsewhere in the region.

The chapter goes into depth about the seafaring prowess and trading vessels used by the Goramese. It explains their vital role as intermediaries in the maritime trade between the Arru Islands, New Guinea, and other islands to the west.

When the author returns to the Arru Islands, he recounts resolving various local disputes over trade conduct between the islands' factions. He provides an update on the Christian teachers' activities and financial struggles.

On islands like Wadia and Wokan, the chapter depicts the ceremonies reappointing government-approved chiefs and distributing official regalia. The author works to reaffirm Dutch authority in the islands.

The chapter ends with the islanders providing intelligence about sightings of "white people" living inland on New Guinea based on second-hand reports, whetting the author's interest to explore there.

Overall, it fleshes out the economic and political relationships between Goram and the Arru Islands under Dutch oversight during this period.
