Here is a summary of Chapter XI: The Arru Islands:

This chapter focuses on the trade and commerce of the Arru Islands. The author provides details on the major trade goods produced there, especially trepang (sea cucumbers), tortoise shell, edible birds' nests, and pearls. He explains the different varieties and values of trepang.

The chapter describes the trading relationships between the Arru islanders and visiting Bugis, Macassar, and Ceramese traders who came to barter for these goods. It notes the high prices the foreign traders could get by reselling the island's products elsewhere.

The author recounts meeting residents of islands like Vorkay who were experts in pearl fishing, though this industry had declined from its former levels. He discusses the slave trade still occurring, with Papuan slaves from New Guinea being bought and sold.

Towards the end, the chapter relates the Arru islanders' joy at the Dutch re-establishing a presence after years of absence. They hoped this would facilitate more direct trade. The author worked to resolve some trade disputes during his visits to different islands in the group.

Overall, this chapter illuminates the economic life, trade relationships, and valuable maritime products of the isolated Arru Islands during this period.
