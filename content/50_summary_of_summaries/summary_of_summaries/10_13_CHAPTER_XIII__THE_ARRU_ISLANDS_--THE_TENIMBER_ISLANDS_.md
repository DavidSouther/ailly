Here is a summary of Chapter XIII: The Arru Islands - The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter marks the author's transition from visiting the Arru Islands to the neighboring Tenimber Islands. He describes stopping at the island of Wadia in the Arrus and resolving a dispute over a recent piracy incident involving people from Wadia. 

The author then sails for the first time to the Tenimber Island group. He arrives at the island of Vordate and receives a friendly welcome from the chiefs, who raise the Dutch flag. However, he learns that some local traders had recently been attacked and plundered by pirates from the Ceram islands.

He provides background on the long-standing tradition of the Ceramese raiders plundering Tenimber trading vessels for their prized goods like trepang. The author commits to trying to get the Ceramese to stop.

The chapter describes the difficulty reaching the inhabited parts of the islands like Timor Laut due to the hazardous reefs and shallows. He makes an unsuccessful attempt to go ashore at the village of Maktia, where his landing party is attacked by natives.

Overall, this chapter transitions the narrative to the Tenimber Islands, a region the Dutch had less influence over. It sets the stage for the author's efforts to re-exert Dutch authority and quell the piracy disrupting local trade.
