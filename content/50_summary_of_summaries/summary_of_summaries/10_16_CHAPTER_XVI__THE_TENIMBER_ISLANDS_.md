Here is a summary of Chapter XVI: The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter describes the author's continued journey among the Tenimber Islands after leaving Serra. He travels by small boat and tender, stopping at various smaller islands like Maling, Laboba, and Wau along the way.

The author provides details about the challenges of navigating the hazardous reefs, shallows, and currents in this island group. He describes going ashore on remote islands to hunt, fish, and resupply water and provisions.

On the island of Maktia, the chapter recounts a tense encounter where hostile natives attack the author's landing party, wounding one of his sailors. This forces the Dutch to withdraw from the island.

As the author tries to make his way to the larger island of Timor Laut, the difficulties of the journey, stormy weather, and sickness among his crew make it impossible to complete. He has to turn back towards Vordate.

The chapter describes the author's final departure from the Tenimber Islands after restocking at Vordate. He laments his inability to secure the release of English captives held on Timor Laut.

Overall, this chapter showcases the logistical challenges of the author's island-hopping expedition and the lingering pockets of hostility from certain island groups, truncating his hopes of extending Dutch influence across the entire Tenimber chain.
