Here is a summary of Chapter VII: Lakor:

This chapter covers the author's visit to the small coral island of Lakor, part of the Southwest Islands group. He has difficulty anchoring his ship close to the low-lying island due to hazardous reefs.

On going ashore, the chapter describes how the native inhabitants initially fled in fear from the arriving Dutch crew, having to be coaxed back with reassurances. The islanders clearly had little experience with European visitors.

The author provides details about the island's barren terrain, which supported few trees or agriculture beyond some coconut groves and yam patches. The population was quite small as a result.

Despite their isolation, the chapter notes that some of the islanders identified as Christians, though only two actual Christian inhabitants lived on Lakor. These maintained some Dutch cultural traditions in their dress and homes.

The author relates the difficulties he faced in conducting his standard ceremonies to reappoint government chiefs and distribute gifts to establish Dutch authority. The unruly, contentious islanders argued over the appointments.

The chapter also depicts the author witnessing and mediating resolutions to serious family/village feuds on Lakor that had descended into armed conflict over seemingly minor disagreements.

Overall, Lakor is portrayed as an isolated, barren island populated by a scattered, quarrelsome, semi-Christianized society largely disconnected from the Dutch authorities until the author's visit to reassert governance.
