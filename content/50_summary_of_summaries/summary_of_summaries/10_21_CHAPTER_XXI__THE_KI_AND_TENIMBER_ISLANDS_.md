Here is a summary of Chapter XXI: The Ki and Tenimber Islands:

This final chapter describes the author's return voyage from New Guinea, stopping first at the Ki Islands located between New Guinea and the Tenimber Islands.

He provides background on the Ki Islanders, describing them as more mild-mannered and peaceable than other islanders in the region. The author notes their livelihoods in activities like ship-building, pottery, and trading.

After the Ki Islands, the chapter recounts the author's stop back at the Tenimber island of Vordate. He finds the island's political situation improved from his earlier peacemaking efforts between feuding factions.

However, the author learns that the Ceramase have been raiding and pirating against Tenimber trading vessels in his absence. He relates the story of two English captives held on Timor Laut who could not be ransomed.

From Vordate, the author takes boats to make a final visit to the island of Serra. He oversees ceremonial reconciliations and legislates settlements between warring family groups and villages.

The chapter's concluding sections describe the author's final departure from the Tenimber Islands and Banda back towards Amboyna. He expresses satisfaction that his diplomatic efforts have helped facilitate peace and re-establish Dutch governance across the islands after decades of instability.

Overall, this last chapter wraps up the author's island-hopping voyage and the reaffirmation of Dutch influence, authority, and trade across the long-neglected Tenimber archipelago.
