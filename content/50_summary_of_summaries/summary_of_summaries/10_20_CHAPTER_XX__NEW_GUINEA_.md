Here is a summary of Chapter XX: New Guinea:

This chapter continues the account of the author's attempts to explore the coast of New Guinea. After the tense encounter with hostile natives described in the previous chapter, the author decides to make another attempt at going ashore.

He sends armed boats and landing parties to try to establish friendly contact and get fresh water supplies. However, the natives launch a sudden treacherous attack on the landing party after initially seeming welcoming.

In the ensuing skirmish, one of the author's Dutch sailors is killed by the native warriors' spears and arrows. Several others are wounded before the boats are able to retreat. The author harshly criticizes the cowardly conduct of the officers leading the shore party for allowing the ambush.

Enraged by the attack, the author leads his own punitive expedition to the shore, destroying native huts and coconut palms to teach the Papua tribesmen a lesson, though no warriors are encountered.

The chapter depicts the author's frustration at being unable to establish meaningful contact with the coastal New Guinea people due to their hostility and mistrust, which he blames on the brutality and deception of earlier Ceramese traders.

With his ships unable to safely resupply, the author is forced to abandon any further exploration of this uncharted New Guinea coastline for the time being and turn back towards the Tenimber Islands.

Overall, this chapter showcases the arduous challenges and violent obstacles facing Europeans attempting to make inroads into the unmapped interior of New Guinea in this era.
