Here is a summary of Chapter XV: The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter continues the author's account of his visit to the Tenimber Islands, particularly the island of Serra. He provides details about the geography, villages, and people of Serra after arriving there by boat from Vordate.

The chapter recounts the author having to mediate and resolve a longstanding violent feud between two parties of chiefs on Serra. He describes the elaborate ceremonial reconciliation process he oversaw to end the hostilities.

It depicts the author officiating over the installation of new government-approved chiefs across Serra's villages. However, he notes the islanders' general lack of respect for hierarchical authority.

The chapter also describes some of the islanders' customs like their unique mourning rituals, burial practices, and making of palm wine. The author witnesses traditional singing, dancing, and ornamentation of Serra's warriors.

Towards the end, the author laments his inability to secure the release of two English captives being held on the island of Timor Laut due to the hazardous landscape preventing travel there.

Overall, this chapter provides an in-depth portrait of the society, traditions, and internal conflicts on the island of Serra that the author worked to bring under renewed Dutch administrative oversight.
