Here is a summary of Chapter XX. New Guinea:

This chapter describes a tragic incident that occurs when the author sends an armed landing party ashore to obtain water, resulting in a deadly confrontation with the native inhabitants of New Guinea.

The author recounts how the Dutch sailors, despite his specific instructions, leave their weapons behind and become careless, allowing the Papuan natives to launch a sudden, unexpected attack. This results in several Dutch casualties, including the death of a soldier, and forces the party to retreat in disarray.

The author expresses his deep disappointment and anger at the cowardly behavior of the Dutch officers in charge, who failed to follow orders and properly prepare and protect their men. He attributes the failure to a combination of the sailors' negligence and the treacherous tactics employed by the hostile natives.

Determined to recover the lost equipment and assert Dutch authority, the author later leads an armed expedition to the village, only to find it abandoned. He orders the destruction of nearby coconut trees as a symbolic punishment, but is unable to directly engage or apprehend any of the native attackers.

The chapter provides insights into the author's views on the causes of the natives' hostility, which he largely blames on the manipulative and exploitative behavior of the Ceramese traders who have long dominated the region. He sees the reestablishment of a direct Dutch colonial presence as crucial to curbing such abuses.

Overall, the chapter conveys the dangers and difficulties the author faces in attempting to assert Dutch control over this remote and hostile territory, further highlighting the challenges of reintegrating New Guinea into the colonial framework.
