Here is a summary of Chapter XXI. The Ki and Tenimber Islands:

The final chapter describes the author's visits to the Ki Islands and his return to the Tenimber Islands, particularly the island of Vordate.

In the Ki Islands, the author notes the industrious and relatively peaceful nature of the inhabitants, who are skilled in shipbuilding and pottery production. He sees the Ki Islanders as more amenable to Dutch colonial rule compared to some of the other groups encountered.

Returning to Vordate in the Tenimber Islands, the author is pleased to find the native population in a much more cooperative and welcoming mood compared to his previous visit. He attributes this to the beneficial effects of his earlier interventions and the restored sense of Dutch authority.

The author goes on to mediate further disputes between warring factions on the Tenimber Islands, using a combination of diplomacy, gift-giving, and the formal installation of new village chiefs. He is encouraged by the natives' growing acceptance of Dutch oversight and their entreaties for the return of a permanent Dutch colonial presence.

Throughout his dealings, the author continues to be struck by the Tenimber Islanders' deep attachment to the Dutch, whom they still view as their rightful colonial overlords. He sees great potential in reintegrating these territories under a renewed Dutch administration.

The chapter and the book conclude with the author's safe return to Amboyna, where his efforts and observations are approved by the colonial government. The narrative underscores the author's conviction that the restoration of direct Dutch control over these remote island groups is both achievable and desirable.
