Here is a summary of Chapter II: Timor:

This chapter describes the author's stop at the island of Timor during his voyage. He arrives at the Portuguese settlement of Dilli on the northwest coast. 

The author depicts Dilli as a poverty-stricken town whose residents, including the Portuguese colonial officials, live in extremely modest conditions. He recounts being received shabbily by the Portuguese governor.

The chapter provides the author's observations about the lack of agriculture and industry in Dilli, despite the fertile lands surrounding it. He learns that the Portuguese derive most of their income from the slave trade, kidnapping natives from the interior and selling them.

The author laments the Portuguese mistreatment and neglect of their native subjects on Timor. He senses the hostility of the indigenous people towards their Portuguese overlords during his brief stay.

After an uncomfortable visit where the Portuguese are unhelpful, the author departs Dilli, sailing next for the island of Wetta, one of the Serwatty (or Southwest) Islands to the north.

Overall, this chapter portrays Timor under sleepy Portuguese rule as an underdeveloped backwater where slavery and indigenous resentment against the colonial authorities is widespread. It sets the stage for the author's subsequent exploration of the lesser-known islands to Timor's north and east.
