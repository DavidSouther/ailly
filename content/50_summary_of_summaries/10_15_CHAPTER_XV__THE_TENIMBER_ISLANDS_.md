Here is a summary of Chapter XV. The Tenimber Islands:

The chapter continues the author's exploration of the Tenimber Islands, focusing on his interactions with the native inhabitants and his efforts to mediate longstanding feuds and disputes between the various village communities.

The author describes in detail the elaborate ceremonies and protocols involved in convening a meeting between the warring factions on the islands of Ewena and Romian. He skillfully navigates the islanders' complex system of custom, rank, and protocol to broker a reconciliation, despite the deeply entrenched enmity between the groups.

The chapter provides insights into the Tenimber Islanders' social structures, with the author noting the importance of hereditary chiefs and the use of fines and payments to resolve conflicts. He is struck by the natives' tendency towards petty squabbling and their resistance to mediation, attributes he attributes to the lack of a sustained Dutch colonial presence in the region.

Through his interventions, the author is able to restore a measure of peace and unity among the Tenimber communities. He appoints new village chiefs and distributes gifts from the Dutch government, further strengthening the islanders' attachment to the colonial power.

Overall, the chapter emphasizes the challenges of governing these remote, fractious populations and the critical role a colonial administration can play in maintaining order and social cohesion. The author's diplomatic efforts foreshadow the broader campaign to reintegrate the Tenimber Islands under Dutch influence.
