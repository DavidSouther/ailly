EXPEDITIONS IN THE MOLUCCA AND JAVA SEAS.

Outward Voyage.--Tristan D'Acunha.--English Settlement.--Expedition
in the Molucca Seas.--Voyage to Palembang and Banka.--Fidelity of
Javanese Seamen.--Expedition to Macassar.--Particulars concerning the
Macassar War.

As an introduction to the narrative, I will communicate to the reader
a short account of my outward voyage to India, and of the various
expeditions in which I was engaged previous to undertaking the voyage
to the eastern parts of the Indian Archipelago, which forms the subject
of this volume.

In January 1817, I was appointed by the Minister of Marine to the
corvette _Venus_, Commander B.W.A. Van Schuler, then lying in the Niewe
Diep, ready for sea on a voyage to Batavia. On the 28th of the same
month we sailed, under a salute of the guns, and having sent away the
pilot with parting letters to our friends, we stood out to sea, the
shores of our beloved country soon fading from view.

Remarkable events seldom occurring during the outward voyage, a few
words will suffice to give an account of our proceedings. In the month
of April we arrived off Tristan D'Acunha, and having espied a number of
huts on the shores of a bay on the north side of the island, we stood
towards them, and anchored in twenty-five fathoms, tolerably close to
the land. When viewed from a distance the island has the appearance of
a single high mountain, the sides rising abruptly out of the sea. The
bay in which we anchored lies open to the sea, and therefore can afford
no shelter to vessels. Its shores were steep and lined with alternate
patches of sand and rock, against which the sea beat with great
violence. The snow-white foam of the surf, glittering in the sun-beams,
contrasted strikingly with the soft green of the uplands; the charming
prospect this afforded being embellished by a beautiful waterfall
tumbling into the sea from the hills above.

The English establishment, which had been fixed here a short time
previous to our visit, consisted of seventy-four men, with their wives,
under the command of Major Kloete, the settlement being a dependance of
the Cape of Good Hope. It had already made great progress, agriculture
being carefully attended to; and among other vegetables we were
delighted to find an abundance of excellent potatoes. The industrious
and orderly habits of these settlers, coupled with their civility
towards strangers, of which we had evidence in the friendly reception
we met with, entitled them to every praise. This settlement, however,
now no longer exists.

After our departure from Tristan D'Acunha we encountered a severe gale,
in which we lost two topmasts, the foremast and bowsprit. Lieutenant
Vendoren with seven seamen also fell overboard, and the former only was
saved. On the 29th of June we arrived at Batavia, and after a short
stay there, departed for the populous town of Sourabaya to refit our
damaged vessel.

The first expedition in which we were engaged was directed against
Ceram and Sapanua, where some serious disturbances had taken place. On
the 22nd of February 1818 we obtained a decided victory over the Sultan
Muda of Batjoli in the Moluccas, for which I believe, our commander, M.
Van Schuler, was made Knight of the third class of the Military Order
of William.

During the whole of the year 1818, we were employed in cruizing among
the Molucca Islands, for the prevention of piracy and the contraband
trade, especially the illegal sale of gunpowder to the natives in
a state of insurrection. The pirates sometimes behave with great
boldness, deriving confidence from the rapidity with which their
light vessels can escape into the numerous creeks; the oars which
they use when the wind is contrary giving them great advantages in
point of swiftness over our cruizers. A couple of steam-boats, which
would be able to follow them into their lurking places, would be very
efficacious in ridding us of these plagues.

On the 12th of January 1819, the then Governor of the Moluccas, General
De Kock, with his family, embarked on board the _Venus_ for the purpose
of being conveyed to Java. We sailed on the following day, and did
not reach Batavia until the 4th of May following. During this tedious
passage, a beautiful collection of the birds of the Moluccas, the
property of the General, died from want of food. Salt meat and biscuit
formed our sole diet during the greater part of the voyage, and it is
surprising that with such provisions, we did not have considerable
sickness on board.

We now proceeded to Sourabaya, being accompanied by Captain Stout,
of the Colonial Marine, with several light vessels. When off the
Taggal Mountain we encountered some piratical vessels, and having been
several times employed with native seamen, speaking their language with
tolerable fluency, I was placed in charge of a Korra-korra, and sent
in chase. Captain Stout met with a sad accident on this occasion. A
gun that had been fired by the Captain himself, perhaps from its being
overloaded, recoiled so much that it burst through the bulwarks on the
opposite side of the vessel and fell overboard, striking the Captain
violently on the breast during its passage, and causing the almost
immediate death of this brave seaman.

In the latter part of the year 1819, the _Venus_ was placed in
readiness to return to the mother country. Our joyful expectations,
however, were soon disappointed, for the disturbances which had broken
out at Palembang, rendered it necessary that the corvette should
proceed there, to be in readiness to act against the Sultan Mohammed
Badr-el-Din; and on the 4th of December we arrived in the roads of
Minto, on the island of Banka, to await the time when our services
would be required.

All prospects of a speedy return home were thus destroyed, but
I consoled myself with the consideration that duty required the
sacrifice, and that I could serve my country in these remote regions as
well as in the Netherlands. Our foreign possessions, indeed, though far
distant, are still provinces of the fatherland.

Actuated by these considerations, I willingly accepted the offer made
to our junior officers to enter the Colonial Navy, and receive the
command of a gun-boat armed with an 18-pounder, two 8-pounders, some
swivels, and manned with thirty men, chiefly Javanese, the same rank
being given me with that I held in the Royal Navy. I was now sent
to the east coast of Banka, for the purpose of keeping the pirates
in check, and of keeping open the communication with the tin mines.
At first I was accompanied by the schooner _Zeemeeuw_, Lieutenant
Alewyn, but this vessel was soon ordered on another station, and
I remained here eight months, in daily contact with the pirates,
without the assistance of other Europeans; this period forming by
no means the most agreeable portion of my stay in India. I had often
serious engagements with the famed Radin Allin, who, however, never
was courageous enough to board the gun-boat. Had he done so, our only
resource would have been to blow up our vessel, to prevent her falling
into the hands of the pirates, as the great superiority of their force
would have rendered it impossible to withstand them. This Radin Allin
displayed great intrepidity on several occasions. Once, while I was
conveying some vessels to Kaba, he took advantage of my absence to
attack and carry the fort of Batu-Rusa, on the Marawang river. On my
return I found him still in the river with a large number of prahus,
where I blockaded him until the month of September 1820, when I at
length received assistance from Minto, at a period when such relief had
become of the greatest necessity, as I had often thought that my last
hour had arrived. Of my crew, only a few natives remained, the others
having either been killed or sent to the hospital.

During these hazardous expeditions I had frequent opportunities of
witnessing the fidelity of the Javanese seamen in the hour of danger.
Their behaviour and disposition prepossessed me very much in favour of
the nation to which they belonged, and during my subsequent voyaging
in India, where I considerably increased my acquaintance with them,
I never had occasion to alter the favourable opinion I had formed.
When a Javanese is treated with consideration, and is not subjected to
tyrannical treatment, he is as much to be trusted as an European, and
submits far more readily to control.

The force which came to my relief consisted of several vessels under
the command of Lieutenant Colonel Keer, destined to act against the
chiefs of the rebels, Radin Allin and Radin Kling, and I now obtained
permission to return to Minto. In the beginning of 1821, I departed
thence for Sourabaya, with the view of having the gun-boat repaired, as
it was ordered to take part in the expedition which during that year
re-established our authority at Palembang. The particulars of that
renowned expedition being still fresh in the memory of my readers, I
will give no circumstantial account of our proceedings, but I will
relate a few occurrences in which I was personally engaged. After
the first attack, when our fleet had retired to its former position,
it was my good fortune to rescue Lieutenant Boerhave and his men,
together with the crew of another gun-boat, both of which had fallen
into the hands of the enemy; and on the following 24th of June, during
the second assault, the gun-boat under my command opened the way
through the strong barricade erected across the river to the attack
of the great floating battery, on which I was the first to plant the
Netherlands flag. As a token of particular approbation on the part
of the Government for this deed, three of my small crew received the
decoration of the military order of William.

After the termination of this renowned expedition, which ended in
the entire conquest of the kingdom of Palembang, I received orders
to accompany General De Kock to Batavia. In the month of August
I was appointed to the schooner _Calypso_, which circumstance I
only mention for the purpose of rendering a just tribute to the
meritorious character of Lieutenant Sondervan her commander. In this
vessel I passed the entire year 1822, making several voyages in her,
circumnavigating Java, and visiting the mines of Sambas and Pontiana,
in Borneo. M. Tobias, the commissioner for our establishments in
Borneo, was on board the schooner the greater portion of the time. The
agreeable society of this gentleman, coupled with the unbroken harmony
that prevailed among us, rendered these voyages extremely pleasant,
notwithstanding the hardships and fatigues we underwent. We made
several journeys into the interior of Borneo, and inspected the mines
of the Chinese, which are here very numerous. I will not particularise
the voyages I subsequently undertook to Banka, Sumatra, and many other
of our possessions, which I performed with pleasure, as they gave me
many opportunities of gathering information concerning these countries
and their native inhabitants.

Having thus passed a considerable time in India, without experiencing
the lassitude of which Europeans in that part of the world so generally
complain, I was appointed adjutant to my former chief, Captain Van
Schuler, who had now become Commandant and Director of the Colonial
Marine. Although I was much pleased by the honourable notice with which
my brave chief favoured me, I soon became tired of an idle life at
Batavia. I had been so long accustomed to the navigation of these seas,
that I could not refrain from soliciting the Governor General, Van Der
Capellen, to place me again in active service.

While performing a journey overland from Batavia to Sourabaya in
company with Captain Van Schuler, I took the opportunity of visiting
Bantjar, in the district of Rembang, where I saw the beautiful frigate
_Javaan_, with several brigs and schooners, then in the course of
construction for the Colonial Navy.[2] The command of one of these was
promised to me on this occasion. I will pass over the description of
this part of Java, as being unconnected with the object of the work. We
met with few occurrences worthy of remark, for I do not consider our
adventure in crossing the Sumadang Mountains, where our carriage was
overturned, of sufficient importance to detain me in my narrative.

On my return to Batavia I was promoted to a Lieutenancy of the first
class in the Colonial Marine, and at my urgent request was suffered
to throw up my appointment as Adjutant, when I was invested with the
command of H.M. Brig _Dourga_,[3] with orders to ship a crew, and
fit her out in readiness to accompany the Governor General on his
expedition to the Moluccas in 1824. So recently promoted, invested
with a new command, and about to become a fellow-voyager with his
Excellency, it will readily be conceived that my zeal was of the
strongest, and that I exerted myself to the utmost to show myself
worthy of the favours that had been conferred upon me.

After remaining a considerable time at Amboyna, a settlement
distinguished by the courtesy and hospitality of its European
inhabitants, we sailed for Banda in the train of the Governor General,
(who was embarked in the frigate _Eurydice_), where we arrived on the
18th of April. The Gunung Api volcano was in a state of violent action
at the time, filling the atmosphere with fire and smoke, the volumes of
the latter being ejected with such force, that their collision caused
constant vivid flashes of lightning, accompanied by a rumbling noise
like that of thunder. This outbreak of nature was indescribably fine
and majestic, and is memorable for having formed a new crater in the
north-west side of the mountain. The town of Banda, remained, however,
uninjured.

From Banda we sailed for Sapanua, an island well known from the war
which took place there in 1817, and I subsequently proceeded to Menado
and Macassar, where I took part in the expedition called forth by the
war that had broken out in Celebes.

The mode of warfare which obtains among the Macassars, differs
considerably from that adopted by the other natives of the Archipelago,
than whom they are more wealthy and better armed, while at the same
time they take the lead in cleverness and ferocity. When under their
own chiefs, they are not remarkable for shewing that courage which
is commonly ascribed to them, especially to the Bughis, this being
displayed rather upon the sea than on land. They will rarely stand
firm against the attacks of regular troops in the field, but fight
well from ambuscades or from behind entrenchments. Their arms consist
of very good guns, manufactured by themselves, with spears, krisses,
klewangs and lelahs.[4] The chiefs and head warriors wear armour, made
of plaited iron or copper wire, which they call baju-ranti or chain
shirt: it will resist a thrust from the klewang or kriss, but affords
no protection against a musket ball.

In the southern parts of Celebes, horses of a very good description
are to be met with, which the natives manage with considerable skill.
A cushion stuffed with cotton, and laid upon the animal's back, forms
their saddle, on which they sit cross-legged, and with this simple
contrivance their seat is so firm that they take bold leaps, and scour
across the country in a manner truly surprising. When a chief is
killed, his relatives and slaves do not care to survive, but a case of
this sort rarely takes place, as the former usually remain on spots
free from danger. The Bughis will carry their slain off the field of
battle at every risk, and will submit to great loss rather than fail
in this object. It is difficult, however, to draw them into making an
assault _en masse_.

We anchored off the town of Macassar on the 5th of July, 1824, the
king of the northern part of the state of which this is the capital,
having by this time followed the example of the Bughis of Boni in
rising against our government. On the 14th of the same month we sailed
for Tannette, (a town on the west coast of Celebes,) with troops and
munitions of war, our vessel forming part of a flotilla consisting
of the brigs Sirene, Nautilus, Jacoba-Elizabeth, and Dourga, with
the corvette Courier, two gun-boats, and some prahus with native
auxiliaries; the naval force being under the orders of Commander Buys,
while the troops were led by Lieutenant Colonel De Steurs. Having
assembled before Tannette, we formed into line and cannonaded the
enemy's fortification, while at the same time the troops were landed
and some gained possession of the forts and villages, together with
some strongholds farther up the country. The loss on our side was
small, but the enemy suffered greatly in killed and wounded. After
sustaining this defeat, the king retired into the interior, and refused
to submit. On the 22nd, Colonel De Steurs departed with the troops
towards Macassar, with the intention of chastising the treacherous
inhabitants of Labakang and Pankalina, those towns lying in the route.
The squadron followed their march along the coast, with the view of
affording assistance should it be required. The number of reefs and
banks render the navigation of the coast hazardous and difficult; but
the fishermen of the islands piloted us through them with safety.
During the passage our armed boats were constantly employed on the
coasts, more for the purpose of checking the plundering propensities
displayed by our native allies from Goa, than for the annoyance of
the enemy. Plunder, indeed, seemed to be the chief object of these
auxiliaries, for when they were required to fight, they either remained
idle or took to their heels.

On the 24th we reached Macassar, the inhabitants of the intermediate
coast having speedily been brought under subjection. The expedition had
been fortunate and successful in every respect, and inspired us with
so much confidence that we eagerly desired to be again led against the
enemy.

An expedition consisting of 200 troops, under the command of
Lieutenant-colonel Reder, was now set on foot to attack the Raja of
Supa, the squadron being again employed in conveying them to their
destination. On the 4th of August we anchored in the bay of Supa, and
as the enemy obstinately refused to negociate, no other course remained
for us than to land the troops, and prepare to carry into effect the
orders of our Government. It immediately became apparent that the
resources of the enemy had been incorrectly reported to us, and that
more difficulty would be experienced in reducing the place than we had
been led to believe would have been the case.

Supa, the capital, is extended near the shore on the north-east side
of the bay, and is difficult of approach from seaward. The town, which
lies low, is bounded on the south side by extensive rice fields, while
to the south-west, in which direction the squadron lay, it is separated
from the sea by a ridge of hills.

On the morning after our arrival, the troops, with detachments of
seamen from the ships, were landed in good order under cover of the
guns of the squadron. Our attack upon the well-fortified town of Supa
was unsuccessful, the troops being driven back to the hills, of which,
however, they maintained possession; the enemy returning into the
town, with the exception of a number of horsemen, who remained at the
foot of the hills, and some detachments which took up positions to the
southward. Towards evening some mortars and brass six-pounders were
landed, and placed in battery against the town. The firing was at first
attended with little loss on either side, but the war-cries of the
Bughis convinced us that they were assembled in great force.

Repeated attempts were now made to set fire to the strongholds of the
enemy, but they were unsuccessful, and attended with considerable loss.
The vessels employed in keeping up the communication with Macassar had
by this time brought a number of native auxiliaries furnished by the
king of Sidenreng, but these took up a position to the southward, and
never emerged from their hiding places.

Information which was now received of our garrisons at Pankalina and
Labakang, consisting of sixty men each, having been overpowered and
massacred to a man, spread dismay and dejection among the troops,
while, through the weak indulgence of our commandant, military
discipline was often disregarded, and our operations consequently, were
deficient in point of combination. A second general assault was not
determined on until the men had been wearied by useless skirmishing.
All the men that could be spared from the ships were now ordered on
shore, and on this as on the previous occasion I served with them; the
command of the left wing of the battery being entrusted to me, while
the right was under the direction of Commander Buys.

At daylight on the 14th, after our batteries had for some time played
with vigour on the town, Lieutenant-colonel Reder advanced to the
attack with one hundred and fifty soldiers, one hundred seamen, and
forty marines, whom the enemy allowed to approach close under the wall
without firing a shot. Their cavalry had in the meantime been posted
out of sight on the south side of the town, and when our troops had
reached the walls, and commenced a sharp combat with those within,
the cavalry fell upon them in flank, penetrated right through them,
and even close up to our breast-works. The confusion created by this
movement was so great, that notwithstanding the efforts of the officers
the flight soon became general, and the disorder communicating itself
to the reserve, the enemy were enabled to cause us considerable loss.
The superior courage of Europeans soon, however, restored matters to
order, for the fire of case-shot from our batteries checked the career
of the enemy, and our troops having by this time rallied became the
assailants in their turn, and drove the Bughis back to their batteries.
Our advantage over the enemy was limited to this, so that our attack
was attended with much bloodshed without being successful. We had
to lament the loss of two brave officers, Lieutenants Van Pelt and
Bannhoff, together with nearly one-third of the men engaged, six of my
own crew being killed on this fatal occasion. During the engagement our
auxiliaries remained in the positions they had taken up, and did not
stir a foot to assist us.

On the evening after this occurrence we were joined by Mr. Tobias,
the commissioner, Colonel De Steurs, and the Raja of Sidenreng, the
latter bringing with him a number of native auxiliaries. The arrival
of Colonel De Steurs gave great joy to our troops, this officer being
universally beloved and esteemed, but of what avail was his presence
now that the pith of our force had been expended in ill-directed
attacks? The enemy occasionally made night attacks on our position, but
were always driven back, our auxiliaries showing on these occasions
more courage than usual, repeatedly pursuing their adversaries close up
to their forts.

On the 22nd, the frigate _Eurydice_ joined the squadron, when a portion
of her crew, with two long eighteen-pounders and some Congreve rockets
were landed; the latter, however, did not answer our expectations
upon trial. Our endeavours to gain an advantage over the enemy were
still unattended by success, and our leader, seeing our force daily
diminished by useless skirmishes, determined on making another general
attack. Every body that could be spared from the ships, natives as
well as Europeans, were landed to join in the assault, the attacking
force now amounting to three hundred men, exclusive of the auxiliaries,
who could not be brought into motion. Our batteries had made several
breaches in the enemy's breast-works, but these had always been
repaired during the following night.

The general attack, which took place early in the morning, was
conducted with much bravery. The road to the town was studded with
sharp stakes, by which many of our people suffered severely. The
enemy in the meantime remained within their entrenchments, protecting
themselves from our shot by sitting in holes dug in the ground; and
on our advancing up to them they fought with desperation, surrounding
their wives and children, and determining to die to the last man rather
than surrender. Our troops were sometimes engaged hand to hand with
the enemy, who opposed our bayonets and swords with their _krisses_
and _klewangs_. At length Colonel De Steurs, finding that many of our
men, with a captain and a first lieutenant, had fallen, determined
to draw off our small body of heroes, with the intention of renewing
the attack with the reserve; but this was found impracticable, as the
latter, which consisted only of a small number of seamen from the
frigate, had already sustained considerable loss. The retreat was
therefore sounded, and thus, for the fourth time, had our efforts
proved unavailing. On this occasion, also, one-third of the attacking
force was placed _hors de combat_. We were, nevertheless, convinced
that had a correct report been given to the government of the force
of the enemy, and had our proceedings been conducted with order and
regularity, the victory must infallibly have been on our side. It is
a consolation, however, to know, that although the enemy maintained
their position, they experienced, in a forcible manner, the superiority
of our courage; for notwithstanding the relaxation of discipline
which at first prevailed, no one can deny that our men displayed
much personal bravery. The expedition, although unsuccessful, had
therefore the effect of inspiring the people of Supa with a dread of
the Dutch arms. According to the account of trustworthy natives, their
loss had been very great; indeed, their successes never gave them
sufficient confidence to emerge from behind their entrenchments. We now
endeavoured to reduce them by a close blockade, but in this we were
also unsuccessful; and this object was not effected until six months
afterwards, when General Geer appeared before the place with a force
much greater than that employed on the previous occasion.

On the 6th of October, the squadron left Supa for Macassar, carrying
away the troops, with the exception of one hundred men, who were left
under the command of Captain Van Doornum. The brig under my command,
together with a gun-boat, also remained, and we were soon joined by
the corvette Courier. On the 20th, I sailed for Macassar, and two days
afterwards, when off Tannette, a number of prahus were seen standing
in towards the fort there, in which we had a garrison of fifty men. On
perceiving the brig the prahus altered their course and stood out to
sea, a proceeding which aroused my suspicion, and as the sea breeze
prevented me from following them, I ran in, and brought up off the
mouth of the river. A small prahu soon came alongside, bringing the
information that the fort was beset on the land side by the enemy, who
threatened an attack with so large a force that our small garrison
could not possibly resist. The commandant wished to embark his men in
the brig and desert the fort; but as I could not receive them without
having received orders to that effect from the governor, I sent one of
the small vessels that attended the brig to Macassar, to make known to
the authorities there the hazardous position we were in. It appeared
that the enemy intended to have attacked the fort both by sea and
land, in which case not one of the garrison would have escaped. My
accidental arrival had fortunately prevented this double attack, which
would not have been the case had I come a day later, or had I missed
the prahus, the appearance of which caused me to anchor off the fort.
I therefore thanked Providence for leading me to adopt the route which
brought me near the besieged place, the garrison of which, but for this
opportune visit, must have experienced the same fate with that which
had already befallen those of Labakang and Pankalina. On the following
day the brig Nautilus arrived to relieve us.

In the mean time the people of Boni had risen, all the tribes to
the northward of Macassar being now in arms against us. The town of
Macassar was often threatened by the enemy, but they never ventured
an attack, being deterred by the force our ally, the king of Goa, had
brought into the field, and by the reinforcements that arrived from
Java. Preparations were now made for a grand expedition, the troops
that had been left at Supa and Tannette being withdrawn from their
uncomfortable posts to join the main force at Macassar.

On the 1st of December I sailed for Sourabaya, the brig being in want
of repairs; and on the 19th of January, 1825, returned to Bonthian
Bay, on the south coast of Celebes. On the 10th of March, General Van
Geen arrived there with the frigate Javaan, and a number of vessels
large and small. The general was accompanied by the Panambahan,[5] of
Samanap, on the island of Madura, who brought with him a number of
native auxiliaries, paid and equipped at his own expense; the Raja of
Goa also furnishing a large number of men for the expedition, who were
armed by our government. The ships of war were attended by a number of
transports; so that the fleet presented a very imposing appearance.

On the 16th of March the fleet sailed from Bonthian Bay, and
passing through the straits of Salayer, entered the Bay of Boni,
without incurring injury from the numerous coral reefs that were
scattered along our route. A melancholy accident occurred soon after
our departure from Bonthian. A detachment of three officers and
ninety-three light infantry men, had been embarked on board a prahu,
totally unfitted for a transport. Some vessels having been perceived
by the people on deck, they called out that some pirates had hove
in sight, on which those who were below rushed up, and climbing on
one side of the vessel, capsized her, only the three officers and
thirty-three of the men being saved.

Our operations commenced at Sengey, where the troops were landed, and
the enemy not only driven helter-skelter out of their intrenchments,
but forced also to evacuate the neighbouring country. The portion of
our force which marched overland having joined us, we pushed forward
to Batjua, the capital of the kingdom of Boni, taking and destroying
the stockades of the enemy as we advanced. Batjua consists of a chain
of beautiful villages, defended by stockades erected in the water and
well provided with guns. It is considered as the seat of the court of
Boni, although the king resides about an hour and a half's journey in
the interior. Being the chief commercial depôt of the kingdom, the
trade is considerable. We found a large number of prahus here, the
greater number of which had been hauled up on the beach to prevent our
destroying them.

General Van Geen determined to effect a landing here, and the enemy
having been drawn away from the beach by a clever _ruse_, the troops
were put on shore without difficulty. The Boniers fled before the
advance of our courageous soldiers, sustaining great loss in their
retreat. The town was found to have been evacuated by the enemy,
although two-hundred pieces of cannon of small calibre were mounted on
the walls. The troops brought to the field by the Panambahan of Samanap
behaved very well in the attack. Notwithstanding their defeat, the
enemy obstinately refused to enter into negotiations with us.

The armed boats of the squadron were constantly employed in landing
the troops, and in attacking the batteries of the enemy. On one of
these occasions we had the misfortune to lose Lieutenant Alewyn, the
commander of the brig Siwa, an officer universally esteemed.

I will pass over in silence many other particulars of minor importance,
connected with this expedition. As the westerly monsoon was now drawing
to a close, and the number of our sick had become very great, we found
it impossible to pursue the enemy into the interior. Macassar had been
freed from danger, Supa had been taken, and the island of Celebes
placed in a state of more tranquillity; but not a single native chief
had been brought under the subjection of our government, so that the
expedition had produced no other useful effect than that of affording
a new proof of the total inability of the natives to withstand the
courage and military skill of Europeans.

On the departure of the fleet from the Bay of Boni, my brig, together
with the _Nautilus_ and the _Daphne_, sailed for Amboyna, touching
at Buton on the way, to obtain refreshments. Every ship that had
been employed had a large number of their men sick, one fifth only
of the crew of my brig being fit for duty. My officers and myself
also suffered much; indeed, on our arrival at Amboyna there was not a
healthy man on board. This prevalence of sickness is to be attributed
to the fatigues we had endured, and it should act as a warning to our
government to deter them from undertaking expeditions like these except
in cases of urgent necessity, or when they have very important objects
in view.

I will now proceed to give an account of the more agreeable duties
entrusted to my charge, which I was fortunate enough to carry into
execution to the satisfaction of the government, and within a tolerably
short period of time.
