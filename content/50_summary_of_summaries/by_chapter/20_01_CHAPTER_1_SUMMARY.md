Here is a summary of Chapter 1 of Voyages of the Dutch brig of war Dourga:

The chapter begins with the author's outward voyage from the Netherlands to Batavia (Jakarta) in 1817 on the corvette Venus. It describes stops at the islands of Tristan d'Acunha and the English settlement there. 

The author then recounts several expeditions he was involved in around the Molucca Islands and western Java between 1818-1822, including combat against pirates and rebels. He was promoted to lieutenant and given command of the brig Dourga in 1823.

In 1824, the Dourga accompanied the Governor General on an expedition to the Moluccas and Banda Islands. The author then describes in detail his involvement in military campaigns against insurgents in Celebes (Sulawesi) in 1824-1825, including failed attacks on the town of Supa and battles around Macassar. 

Despite some setbacks, the Dutch were ultimately able to subdue the rebellions in Celebes through further military campaigns led by General Van Geen in 1825. However, the fighting took a toll with many Dutch sailors falling ill from the strenuous conditions. The chapter closes with the author anticipating describing more agreeable duties in upcoming voyages.
