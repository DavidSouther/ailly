Here is a summary of Chapter XII. The Arru Islands:

This chapter continues the author's exploration of the Arru Islands, focusing on the island of Wokan and the settlement of Dobbo, an important trading hub.

The author describes the general assembly of the Arru Island chiefs he convenes on Wokan, where he formally installs new leaders and distributes gifts from the Dutch government. He is struck by the islanders' enthusiastic displays of loyalty and attachment to Dutch rule, despite the long absence of a Dutch presence.

The author also visits the trading settlement of Dobbo, situated on a spit of sand between the islands of Wama and Wokan. He notes Dobbo's strategic location and potential as a site for a Dutch fort or trading post, observing the bustling seasonal trade that attracts vessels from across the region.

The chapter provides details on the Arafuras' hunting of birds-of-paradise and the trepang fishing industry, which sustains much of the Arru Islands' commerce. The author sees great economic potential in formalizing and regulating this trade under renewed Dutch administration.

Overall, the chapter highlights the enduring loyalty of the Christianized Arru Islanders to the Dutch, as well as the commercial opportunities that await the Dutch should they choose to reassert a stronger colonial presence in the region. The author's observations point to the benefits that could be derived from reinvigorating Dutch control.
