Here is a summary of Chapter XVI. The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter chronicles the author's further explorations and encounters in the Tenimber Islands, including a tragic incident involving an attack on his boat crew.

The author describes his journey to the island of Maling, where he hopes to gather more information about the coast of New Guinea. However, upon arriving at the nearby village of Maktia, the unarmed boat crew is ambushed by the native inhabitants, resulting in several casualties, including the death of a Dutch soldier.

The author expresses his dismay at the cowardly behavior of the officers in charge of the boat expedition, who failed to follow his instructions and properly prepare and arm the crew for potential hostility. He personally returns to Maktia to investigate the incident and recover the remaining supplies and equipment left behind.

The chapter also recounts the author's efforts to broker a peace agreement between warring factions on the island of Serra, drawing on his previous experiences mediating conflicts in the Tenimber region. Despite the challenges, he is able to facilitate a reconciliation between the opposing parties.

Throughout the chapter, the author continues to note the natives' deep-seated attachment to the Dutch colonial government, as well as their pleas for the restoration of a permanent Dutch presence to provide stability and protection. The tragic events at Maktia underscore the dangers the author and his crew face in these remote, untamed territories.

Overall, the chapter highlights the precarious nature of the author's mission and the complexities of reestablishing Dutch authority in the face of native suspicion and violence.
