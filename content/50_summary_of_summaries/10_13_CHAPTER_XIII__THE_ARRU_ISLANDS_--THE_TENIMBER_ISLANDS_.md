Here is a summary of Chapter XIII. The Arru Islands--The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter describes the author's transition from the Arru Islands to the neighboring Tenimber Islands. Upon arriving at the island of Vordate in the Tenimber group, the author encounters a lukewarm reception from the natives, who appear wary and suspicious of his intentions.

The author provides details on the geography and inhabitants of the Tenimber Islands, noting their relative isolation and lack of contact with the Dutch in recent decades. He observes the islanders' primitive weapons and warlike tendencies, as well as their belief that the English are a mountain-dwelling, barbarian people.

The chapter recounts a tragic incident in which an English trading vessel was attacked and plundered by the hostile inhabitants of the eastern Tenimber island of Timor-Laut. The author is unable to fully investigate this event or secure the release of the two English captives, but he conveys the natives' deep distrust of outsiders.

Despite the challenges, the author is able to formally install new village chiefs on Vordate and distribute gifts from the Dutch government. He senses the islanders' underlying attachment to Dutch rule and their desire for the restoration of a Dutch colonial presence to provide stability and protection.

Overall, the chapter highlights the difficulty of reengaging with these remote, insular populations that have grown distrustful and belligerent in the absence of sustained Dutch influence. It foreshadows the challenges the author will face in his subsequent efforts to reintegrate the Tenimber Islands under the Dutch colonial framework.
