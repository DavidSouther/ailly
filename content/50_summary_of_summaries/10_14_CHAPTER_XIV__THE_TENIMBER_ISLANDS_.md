Here is a summary of Chapter XIV. The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter details the author's continued exploration of the Tenimber Islands, with a focus on the island of Timor-Laut. He finds the native inhabitants to be wary and suspicious of his presence, likely due to the earlier attack on the English trading vessel.

The author provides a vivid description of the Tenimber Islanders' warlike customs and appearance, noting their elaborate headdresses, body armor, and tendency towards inter-village conflicts. He is struck by their primitive weapons and tactics, as well as their fondness for intoxicating palm wine.

Despite the initial distrust, the author is eventually able to gain the cooperation of the Timor-Laut chiefs and convene a meeting to formally install new village leaders under Dutch authority. The islanders express their desire for the return of Dutch rule and protection, having suffered from the arbitrary actions of visiting traders in the absence of a colonial presence.

The author is impressed by the Tenimber people's attachment to the Dutch and their willingness to submit to Dutch governance, seeing this as an opportunity to reestablish a beneficial colonial relationship. He departs the island with a sense of optimism about the prospects for reintegrating this remote territory under Dutch control.

Overall, the chapter highlights the challenge of overcoming native suspicion and reengaging with populations that have grown estranged from Dutch influence, while also pointing to the potential benefits of reasserting a stronger colonial presence in the region.
