Here is a summary of Chapter XIV: The Tenimber Islands:

This chapter focuses on the author's visit to the Tenimber island of Vordate. He describes the warm welcome he received from the native inhabitants, who were eager to renew ties with the Dutch after a long absence. 

The author provides details about the physical geography of Vordate and the other Tenimber islands, portraying them as fertile with abundant crops and livestock. He depicts the natives' style of dress, adornments, and warrior traditions.

A large portion recounts the author successfully mediating a peace between two feuding villages on Vordate that had descended into warfare over minor insults and attacks. He officiates an elaborate ceremony and reconciliation between the rival chiefs.

The chapter also describes the islanders' excitement at the Dutch distributing official staffs and documents reappointing their traditional leaders and hoping for a Dutch garrison. However, the natives' requests for assistance against Ceramase pirates went unheeded.

Towards the end, the author's attempts to travel to other islands like Kalioba are marred by the hostility of some island groups. But his peaceful mission is largely successful on Vordate at least.

Overall, this chapter highlights the author's diplomatic efforts to restore Dutch authority and order to the internecine conflicts destabilizing the Tenimber island communities.
