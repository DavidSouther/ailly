Here is a summary of Chapter III. The Serwatty Islands:

The chapter describes the author's visit to the Serwatty Islands, a group previously under Dutch control. Upon arriving at the island of Wetta, the author finds the inhabitants living in poverty after their village was destroyed by the people of Lette several years earlier.

The author meets with the Christian native chiefs Hura and Dirk-Cobus, who express their desire to live again under Dutch protection and request the return of a Dutch garrison to the island. The author promises to advocate for their interests with the government.

Proceeding to the island of Kissa, the author finds the inhabitants to be more prosperous and advanced in their civilization. The island was previously the seat of a Dutch residency, and the people have maintained their Christian faith and attachment to Dutch rule, despite the lack of a Dutch presence in recent years.

The author describes the neat, orderly village of Marna, the large and well-maintained church, and the evident industry and prosperity of the Kissa islanders. He oversees the formal installation of new chiefs and the distribution of gifts from the government.

Overall, the chapter highlights the longing of these island populations for the return of Dutch authority and protection, as well as their relative state of advancement or decline depending on the level of previous Dutch engagement.
