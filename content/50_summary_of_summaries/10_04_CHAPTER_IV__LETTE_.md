Here is a summary of Chapter IV. Lette:

The chapter describes the author's visit to the island of Lette, where he finds the inhabitants living in a state of poverty and disunity. The island had recently suffered from a hurricane, drought, and other natural disasters that devastated the local economy and infrastructure.

The author notes the division between the Christian and heathen native populations, as well as constant feuding and litigation among the various village chiefs and communities. He works to mediate these disputes and restore a sense of order and unity.

The author distributes gifts from the government and oversees the formal installation of an Upper Orang Kaya (chief) to provide stronger leadership. He is struck by the islanders' tendency towards petty squabbling and their difficulty in resolving conflicts, which he attributes to the lack of a sustained Dutch presence and authority.

However, the author finds the people receptive to his efforts at reconciliation, and he is able to leave the island with a more positive outlook, having established a framework for restoring Dutch influence and guidance. The chapter highlights the challenges of governing these remote island communities in the absence of a firm colonial administration.
