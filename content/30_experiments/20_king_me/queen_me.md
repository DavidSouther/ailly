prompt: What does Queen Me mean?
---
"Queen Me" is a phrase from checkers, similar to "king me". It suggests a promotion to the highest level or a significant upgrade. However, in checkers, the term "queen me" is not officially used because there is no queen in the game. The correct term when a player's piece reaches the opposite side of the board is "king me".
