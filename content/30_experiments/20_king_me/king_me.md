prompt: What does "king me" mean?

"King me" is a phrase used in the game of checkers when a player's piece has reached the last row on the opponent's side of the board. This phrase is used to request that the piece be crowned as a 'king', allowing it to have more freedom of movement, including moving or jumping backward.
