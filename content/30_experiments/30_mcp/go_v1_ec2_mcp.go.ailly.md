Here's my analysis:

### Code Review and Recommendations

1. **Upgrade to AWS SDK for Go v2**
   - The provided code uses AWS SDK for Go v1, which AWS has announced will reach end-of-support on July 31, 2025.
   - AWS recommends migrating to AWS SDK for Go v2 for better performance, modularity, and future support.

2. **Error Handling Issue**
   - The code contains an incorrect error code check:
   ```go
   if aerr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok && aerr.Code() == "InvalidKeyPair.Duplicate" {
       exitErrorf("Key pair %q does not exist.", pairName)
   }
   ```
   - According to the documentation in multiple language examples, the correct error code for a key pair not found is "InvalidKeyPair.NotFound", not "InvalidKeyPair.Duplicate".
   - Using "InvalidKeyPair.Duplicate" is confusing since it suggests a duplicate key pair, which is contradictory to the error message stating that the key pair doesn't exist.

3. **Context Missing**
   - AWS SDK for Go v2 uses context for API calls, which allows for better request cancellation and timeout control.
   - The current implementation doesn't use contexts.

4. **Region Configuration**
   - The code hardcodes the region to "us-west-2", which may not be appropriate for all deployments.
   - Consider making the region configurable via environment variables or command-line flags.

5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Error handling could be improved with more detailed error information and proper error type identification.

### Modernized Code Example

Here's how the code could be modernized using AWS SDK for Go v2:

```go
// Copyright Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates. All Rights Reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"time"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/ec2"
	"github.com/aws/smithy-go"
)

// Deletes an EC2 key pair for the name provided. No error will be returned
// if the key pair does not exist.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ec2_delete_keypair.go KEY_PAIR_NAME
func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 2 {
		exitErrorf("pair name required\nUsage: %s key_pair_name",
			filepath.Base(os.Args[0]))
	}
	pairName := os.Args[1]

	// Create a context with a timeout for the API call
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// Load the SDK configuration with default settings
	// This will look up the region from the shared config or environment variables
	cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		exitErrorf("Unable to load SDK config: %v", err)
	}

	// Create an EC2 service client
	client := ec2.NewFromConfig(cfg)

	// Delete the key pair by name
	_, err = client.DeleteKeyPair(ctx, &ec2.DeleteKeyPairInput{
		KeyName: aws.String(pairName),
	})
	if err != nil {
		// Check for specific error types
		var apiErr smithy.APIError
		if errors.As(err, &apiErr) {
			if apiErr.ErrorCode() == "InvalidKeyPair.NotFound" {
				fmt.Printf("Key pair %q does not exist, no action needed.\n", pairName)
				return
			}
		}
		exitErrorf("Unable to delete key pair: %s, %v.", pairName, err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Successfully deleted %q key pair\n", pairName)
}

func exitErrorf(msg string, args ...interface{}) {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, msg+"\n", args...)
	os.Exit(1)
}
```

### Key Improvements in the Modernized Version:

1. **Uses AWS SDK for Go v2** - Migrated to the recommended newer version of the SDK.

2. **Context-based Operations** - Added context support for better timeout and cancellation handling.

3. **Dynamic Configuration** - Uses the default configuration loader which checks environment variables, shared credentials, and more.

4. **Improved Error Handling** - Correct error code checking for "InvalidKeyPair.NotFound" and using the modern errors.As approach for type assertions.

5. **Better Error Response** - For missing key pairs, provides a more informative message rather than exiting with an error.

These changes make the code more maintainable, follow current AWS best practices, and prepare it for continued support beyond the v1 SDK end-of-life date.
