  Write the README.md for the workflow. The readme is independent of any specific language, and should be written generically to allow a programmer from any language to understand what the workflow will do, without needing to know Python for the implementation.

I'll create a README.md file for the Amazon SES V2 coupon newsletter workflow that's language-agnostic and explains the workflow clearly.

# Amazon SES Coupon Newsletter Workflow

This workflow demonstrates how to create a coupon newsletter system using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) V2. The example shows how to manage contacts, create email templates, and send personalized coupon emails to subscribers.

## Overview

This workflow guides you through creating a complete newsletter system with the following features:

- Setting up email identities for sending and receiving emails
- Creating and managing a contact list for newsletter subscribers
- Allowing users to sign up for the newsletter
- Sending welcome emails to new subscribers
- Creating templated coupon emails
- Sending personalized newsletters to all subscribers

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Application Setup

- Create a verified email identity for sending and receiving emails
- Set up a contact list for newsletter subscribers

### 2. Newsletter Signup Process

- Collect email addresses from users who want to subscribe
- Add each new subscriber to the contact list
- Send a welcome email to confirm their subscription
- Repeat for multiple subscribers

### 3. Sending Coupon Newsletters

- Create an email template for coupon offers
- Populate the template with coupon details
- Retrieve the list of all subscribers
- Send personalized coupon emails to each recipient

### 4. Newsletter Analytics

- Review email sending statistics in the AWS Console
- Track delivery, open rates, and other metrics
