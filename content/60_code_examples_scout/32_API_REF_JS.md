# JavaScript API References for Amazon SES v2 Coupon Newsletter Workflow

## Core APIs Required for the Workflow

### 1. Email Identity Management
- **CreateEmailIdentity**
  - Used to verify sender email addresses
  - Main parameters: 
    - `EmailIdentity`: The email address to verify

### 2. Contact List Management
- **CreateContactList**
  - Creates a list to store newsletter subscribers
  - Main parameters:
    - `ContactListName`: Name of the list ("CouponNewsletter")
    - Optional: `Description`, `Topics` for categorizing contacts

- **CreateContact**
  - Adds a subscriber to a contact list
  - Main parameters:
    - `ContactListName`: The name of the contact list
    - `EmailAddress`: Email address of the subscriber
    - Optional: `TopicPreferences`, `AttributesData` for storing subscriber metadata

- **ListContacts**
  - Retrieves contacts from a contact list
  - Main parameters:
    - `ContactListName`: The name of the contact list to query
    - Optional: `Filter` to get only opted-in contacts

### 3. Email Sending
- **SendEmail** (Simple format)
  - Sends welcome emails to new subscribers
  - Main parameters:
    - `FromEmailAddress`: Sender's email address
    - `ReplyToAddresses`: Email for recipients to reply to
    - `Destination`: Object containing recipient addresses
    - `Content.Simple`: Contains `Subject` and `Body` (with both HTML and Text versions)

- **CreateEmailTemplate**
  - Creates reusable templates for coupon emails
  - Main parameters:
    - `TemplateName`: Name of the template
    - `SubjectPart`: Email subject line
    - `HtmlPart`: HTML content with placeholder variables
    - `TextPart`: Plain text version with placeholder variables

- **SendEmail** (Template format)
  - Sends personalized template-based emails to subscribers
  - Main parameters:
    - `FromEmailAddress`: Sender's email address
    - `ReplyToAddresses`: Email for recipients to reply to
    - `Destination`: Object containing recipient addresses
    - `Content.Template`: Contains `TemplateName` and `TemplateData` with values for placeholders

## JavaScript SDK Import Pattern
```javascript
// SES v2 Client
import { SESv2Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";

// Command imports
import { CreateEmailIdentityCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";
import { CreateContactListCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";
import { CreateContactCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";
import { CreateEmailTemplateCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";
import { ListContactsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";
import { SendEmailCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2";
```

## Implementation Pattern
1. Create the SES client:
   ```javascript
   const sesClient = new SESv2Client({ region: "REGION" });
   ```

2. Create and execute commands:
   ```javascript
   const command = new CommandName(parameters);
   try {
     const response = await sesClient.send(command);
     // Handle success
   } catch (error) {
     // Handle specific errors like AlreadyExistsException
   }
   ```

## Error Handling
Common errors to handle:
- `AlreadyExistsException`: When creating resources that already exist
- `NotFoundException`: When referencing resources that don't exist
- `LimitExceededException`: When hitting service quotas
- `TooManyRequestsException`: When exceeding API rate limits
- `MessageRejected`: When an email can't be sent

This JavaScript SDK reference should provide the necessary information for implementing the coupon newsletter workflow as specified.
