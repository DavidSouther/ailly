  The next step is to handle the case where package version is "latest", this is a special keyword that gets the most recent package version.  If package version is set to latest, we need to find out what the  latest version is before we grep
---

Okay, got it. Here's how we can handle the case where the package version is set to "latest":

1. First, we need to check if the package version is set to "latest".
2. If it is, we need to find the latest version of the package before we can perform the grep.
3. We can use a package management tool like `npm` or `yarn` to retrieve the latest version of the package.
4. Once we have the latest version, we can then perform the grep operation.

Here's the pseudocode:

```
if package_version == "latest":
    # Get the latest version of the package
    latest_version = get_latest_version(package_name)
    
    # Perform the grep operation with the latest version
    grep_result = grep(package_name, latest_version)
else:
    # Perform the grep operation with the specified version
    grep_result = grep(package_name, package_version)

# Display the grep result
display_result(grep_result)
```

In the above pseudocode, the `get_latest_version()` function is responsible for fetching the latest version of the package. The implementation of this function will depend on the package management tool you're using (e.g., `npm` or `yarn`).

Once you have the latest version, you can proceed with the grep operation and display the result.
