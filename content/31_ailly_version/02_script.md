  The next step is to handle the case where package version is "latest", this is
  a special keyword that gets the most recent package version.  If package
  version is set to latest, we need to find out what the  latest version is
  before we grep
---
Sure, here's the updated script that handles the case where `package_version` is set to `"latest"`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

package_name="@ailly/cli"
package_version="latest"

# If package_version is "latest", get the latest version number
if [ "$package_version" = "latest" ]; then
    package_version=$(npm view "$package_name" version)
fi

# Check if the package is installed globally
if ! npm list -g "$package_name" | grep -q "$package_version"; then
    echo "Installing $package_name@$package_version globally..."
    npm install -g "$package_name@$package_version"
else
    echo "$package_name@$package_version is already installed globally."
fi
```

Here's what's different in this script:

1. We first check if `package_version` is set to `"latest"`. If it is, we use the `npm view` command to get the actual latest version of the package. The `npm view` command displays the latest version of the specified package without installing it.

2. If `package_version` is not `"latest"`, we simply reassign its value to `package_version`.

This way, if `package_version` is set to `"latest"`, the script will determine the actual latest version of the package and use that for installation or checking if it's already installed.

Note that this script assumes that the `npm view` command is available and working correctly. If you encounter any issues with `npm view`, you may need to explore alternative ways to retrieve the latest package version, such as using a package registry API or parsing the output of `npm show` command.
