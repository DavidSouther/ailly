# Ailly - AI Writing Ally

Ailly provides a quick and easy way to use files on your file system as prompts for GenAI and LLM.

## Features

### Context Menu

Right Click a file or folder and select "Ailly: generate". This will send either the file as a single prompt, or all files in the folder as an ordered set of prompts, to the configured LLM provider.

### Command Pallette

Open a file. Select `Ailly: generate`. This will send the file as a single prompt to the configured LLM provider.

## Configuration

Ailly stores API keys on your behalf. This probably isn't secure. Please help with a PR to improve that.
